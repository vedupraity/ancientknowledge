                                                            The sage Agastya had a learned disciple, Sutiksna by name, who was a great lover of the Lord. He was devoted to Sri Rama's feet in thought, word and deed and had no faith in any other deity even in dream. As soon as the news of the Lord's approach reached his ears he rushed out hurriedly, indulging in his own fancy: "Will the Lord of Raghus, the befriender of the meek, O good heavens, ever show His grace to a wretch like me? Will Lord Sri Rama and His younger brother receive me as their own servant? I have no unswerving faith in my heart nor is my mind illumined by the light of devotion, dispassion or wisdom. I have no association with saints and practise neither Yoga (concentration of mind) nor Japa ( muttering of prayers), nor the ritual. Nor do I claim any steadfast devotion to the Lord's lotus feet. I bank on one characteristic of the all-merciful Lord; He holds the devotee dear who depends exclusively on HIm. This inspires me with the hope that my eyes will be rewarded today by the sight of the Lord's lotus face, that delivers one from the bondage of worldly existence." The wise was drowned in a flood of love; his condition. O Parvati, cannot be described in words. He had no idea of the four quarters, much less of the intermediate points of the compass; nor could he make out the track. He did not know who he was or whither bound. He would now turn back and then resume his journey in the same direction; and now he would dance and sing songs of praise. The sage had been gifted with devotion of the nature of intense love and the Lord watched him hiding behind a tree. When the Hero of Raghu's line, who dispels the fear of transmigration, saw the sage's excessive love, He revealed Himself in his heart. The sage sat motionless in the middle of the road, his body bristling like a jack-fruit with its hair standing on end. The Lord of Raghus thereupon drew near and was delighted at heart to see the state of His devotee. Sri Rama tried many ways to rouse the sage; but he would not wake, lost as he was in the ecstasy of his vision. Sri Rama then withdrew His kingly guise and manifested His fourarmed form in the sage's heart. The sage thereupon started up in great agony, growing as restless as a noble serpent that has lost the gem on its head. But seeing before him the blissful Rama in His swarthy form with Sita and His younger brother (Laksmana), the great and blessed sage was overwhelmed with affection and dropped like a log at His feet. Taking him in His long arms the Lord lifted him and with utmost affection pressed him to His bosom. While embracing the sage the gracious Lord shone forth like a Tamala tree meeting a tree of gold. The sage gazed on Sri Rama's face standing motionless like a figure drawn in a picture.

                                                            Said the sage, "Listen, O Lord, to my prayer: how am I to hymn Your praises? For immeasurable is Your glory and scant my wit, which is as insignificant as the flash of a fire-fly before the sun. I constantly glorify Sri Rama (the Chief of Raghus), with a body dark as a string of blue lotuses, wearing a crown of matted locks on His head and clad in a hermit's robes, and carrying a bow and arrow in His hands with a quiver fastened to His waist. The fire which consumes the thick forest of delusion, the sun that brings delight to the lotus-like saints, the lion who kills the herd of elephants in the form of demons, the hawk that kills the bird of metempsychosis, may He ever protect us. I extol Sri Rama, whose eyes resemble the red lotus, who is elegantly dressed, who is a full moon to Sita's Cakora like eyes, who is a cygnet disporting in the Manasa lake of Lord Siva heart and who has a broad chest and long arms. A Garuda to devour the serpent of doubt, the queller of despair induced by heated controversy, the uprooter of transmigration, the delighter of gods, the embodiment of compassion, may He ever protect us, I sing the praises of Sri Rama, the reliever of earth's burden, who is both with and without attributes, who is partial as well as impartial, who transcends knowledge, speech and the senses and has no compeer, nay, who is all-pure, all-comprehensive, faultless and unlimited. A veritable garden of wish-yielding trees to His devotees, who keeps away wrath, greed, pride and lust, who is most urbane in manners and the bridge to cross the ocean of mundane existence, may that champion of the solar race ever protect me. Matchless in power of arm, the home of strength, the armour for the protection of righteousness, endowed with a host of delightful virtues, may that Rama whose very Name wipes out the greatest sins of the Kali age, be ever propitious to me. Even though He is passionless, all-pervading, imperishable and ever dwelling in the heart of all, let Him abide in my thoughts as the Slayer of Khara roaming about in the woods with His younger brother (Laksmana) and Sita. Let alone, my lord, those who know You to be both with and without attributes and the witness of all hearts. As for myself may Sri Rama, the lotus-eyed Lord of Kosala, take up His abode in my heart. Let not this exalted feeling disappear from my mind even in an unguarded moment that I am His servant and the Lord of Raghus my master." Sri Rama was delighted at heart to hear the sage's words, and in His delight He pressed the great sage to His bosom again. "Know Me to be supremely pleased, O sage; I am prepared to grant you any boon you may choose to ask." The sage replied, "I have never asked any boon and know not what is real and what unreal (what to choose and what to reject). Therefore, O Delighter of Your devotees, grant me that which pleases You, O Lord of Raghus." "May you become a repository of worldly wisdom and goodness as well as of intense devotion, dispassion and spiritual wisdom." "I have received the boon that my Lord has been pleased to grant. Now vouchsafe to me that which is cherished by me."

                                                            So be it," said Sri Rama ( the Abode of Laksmi) as He joyously started on His visit to the jar-born sage, Agastya. " It is a long time since I last saw my Guru and came to live in this hermitage. Now, my lord, I will go with You to see my Guru; thus I am not putting You under any obligation." The Fountain of Mercy saw through the sage's cleverness and both the brothers smiled as they took him with them. Discoursing on the way on the incomparable cult of devotion to His own feet Sri Rama (the King of the gods) arrived at the hermitage of the sage ( Agastya). Sutiksna immediately saw his Guru and after prostrating himself before the latter thus addressed him, "My lord, the two sons of King Dasaratha (Kosala's lord), the support of the world, have come to see you-Sri Rama, accompanied by His younger brother (Laksmana) and Videha's Daughter (Sita), whose Name you repeat night and day, venerable sir." Agastya started up as soon as he heard this and ran; at the sight of Sri Hari his eyes filled with tears. The two brothers fell at the sage's lotus feet; but the sage took and clasped them to his bosom with the utmost affection. Courteously enquiring after their welfare the enlightened sage conducted them to an exalted seat and then offered worship in various ways to the Lord, saying "There is no other man so blessed as I am." Whatever other sages had assembled there, were all delighted to behold the Fountain of Joy.

                                                            Then said Sri Rama (the Hero of Raghu's line) to the sage, " I have nothing to hide from you, my lord. You know what for I have come; that is why, holy father, I have not dwelt at length on this point. Now, my good sir, give me some advice, by following which I may be able to kill the enemies of the hermits." The sage smiled when he heard the Lord's remarks. "With what intention have You asked me this question? It is by virtue of my devotion to You, O Destroyer of sins, that I know a bit of Your glory. Your Maya (Creative Energy) is like a huge tree of the species known by the name of Udumbara, with the countless multitudes of universes for its clustering fruits. The animate and inanimate beings (inhabiting the various universes) are like the insects that dwell inside the fruits and know of no other fruit (besides the one they inhabit ). The relentless and dreadful Time-spirit devours these fruits; but even that (all-devouring) Time ever trembles in fear of You. You, who are the suzerain lord of all the regional lords, have asked my advice as though You were an ordinary human being. I ask this boon of You, O Home of mercy: pray dwell in my heart with Your Spouse (Sita) and younger brother (Laksmana) and let me have intense devotion, dispassion, fellowship with the saints and unbroken love for Your lotus feet. Even though I know You to be the same as the indivisible and infinite Brahma (the Absolute), who can only be realized ( and cannot be known by any other means) and is adored by the saints, and even though I depict You as such, I feel enamoured of Your qualified form again and again. You have always exalted Your servants; that is why You have thought fit to consult me, O Lord of Raghus. There is, my lord, a most charming and holy spot; it is called Pancavati. Sanctify the Dandaka forest (where it is situated) and redeem it from the terrible curse of the great sage (Sukracarya). Take up Your abode there, O Lord of Raghu's line, and show Your grace to all the sages." On receiving the sage's permission Sri Rama departed and drew near to Pancavati in no time.
