The minister (Sumantra) helped his sovereign to a sitting posture, when the latter beheld Rama falling at his feet. Overwhelmed with emotion the king clasped Him to his bosom as though a serpent had regained its lost gem. The monarch kept gazing on Sri Rama and a torrent of tears streamed forth from his eyes. Overpowered with grief he could not utter a word and pressed the prince to his heart again and again. He inwardly prayed to God that the Lord of Raghus (Sri Rama) might not be able to proceed to the woods. Invoking the mighty Lord Siva he solicited Him saying, "Hear my prayer, O ever-blissful Lord! Quickly pleased and indiscreetly generous as You are, pray relieve my affliction knowing me to be in distress.

Subject me to all severe hardships; but let not Rama be screened from my view." The king thus prayed within his heart but did not open his lips; his mind quivered like an aspen leaf. Perceiving that His father was overpowered with affection, and apprehending that mother Kaikeyi might utter something again, the Lord of Raghus (Sri Rama) spoke after due deliberation words which were not only humble but also suited to the place, time and circumstances. "Dear father, I make bold to submit something; pray forgive this impropriety on my part knowing that I am yet tender of age. You have suffered for a most trifling matter; and the pity of it is that nobody apprized me of it before. When I saw you I asked mother Kaikeyi, and was consoled to hear what she has told me."

He has in his hand all the four prizes of life, (viz., religious merit, material riches, sensuous gratification and final beatitude), to whom his parents are dear as life. After carrying out your order and having obtained the reward of my life I shall come back soon; therefore be pleased to command me. In the meantime I shall ask leave of mother Kausalya and return forthwith; then I shall proceed to the woods after throwing myself once more at your feet." So spoke Sri Rama and then departed; while the king was too overpowered with grief to make any answer. This most unwelcome news spread throughout the city as though the sting of a scorpion had circulated its poison throughout the body. Every man and woman who heard this was distressed even as trees and creepers are blasted at the very sight of a forest fire. Whoever heard it beat his head wherever he happened to be; the grief was too great to be borne.

"What sense could there be in this wicked woman having set fire to a house that had been newly thatched! She seeks to perceive after tearing out her eyes with her own hands, and wishes to taste poison throwing away nectar. This crooked hard-hearted and evil-minded wretch has appeared as fire to burn the cluster of bamboos in the shape of Raghu's race. Sitting on a twig she has hewn the tree itself; in the midst of joy she has raised a structure of sorrow. Sri Rama had always been dear to her as life: What has led her to resort to such perversity? Seers have truly said that a woman's mind is altogether incomprehensible, unfathomable and shrouded in mystery. Sooner may a man catch his own reflection than know the ways of a woman.

Some people said, "The king has not done well; he has not been discreet in granting the wicked woman her request, whereby he has wilfully courted all this tragedy. By allowing himself to be ruled by a woman he has lost his wisdom and goodness as it were." Others who were saner did not blame the king, recognizing as they did his high standard of morality. They repeated at length to one another the narratives of Sibi, Dadhici and Hariscandra*. Some suggested Bharata's connivance, while still others passively heard what their companions said. Others stopped their ears with their hands and bit their tongue as they exclaimed, "This is untrue. All your merits will be destroyed as Sri Rama is dear to Bharata as his own life."

                                                            Some blamed the Creator, who had offered nectar but actually given them poison. The whole city was astir and everyone felt distressed. There was deep agony in their heart and their briskness was gone. Brahmana matrons and other venerable and elderly ladies of the royal family and such other ladies as were most dear to Kaikeyi began to expostulate with her praising her amiability; but their words pierced her like shafts. "You have always said, and the whole world knows it, that Bharata is not so dear to you as Rama. You have borne natural affection towards Rama; for what offence do you exile him to the woods today? You have never harboured jealousy towards your co-wives; your loving disposition and credulity are known throughout the land. What wrong has Kausalya done you now due to which you should have hurled this thunderbolt against the whole city.

By all means instal Bharata as the Prince-Regent; but what need is there for exiling Rama to the forest? Rama is not covetous of sovereignty; he is a champion of righteousness and has no relish for sensuous pleasures. Let Rama abandon his home and live with his preceptor; ask this of the king as your second boon. In case you do not follow our advice, you will gain nothing. If you have only played some joke, let us know by openly declaring it. Does a son like Rama deserve to be exiled to the woods? What will the world say about you when they hear of it? Up quickly and devise some means to avert grief and obloquy."

She stared at them as a hungry tigress would gaze on a herd of does. Finding her disease incurable, her friends left her saying as they went, 'Wretched fool! Fate could not brook her sovereignty and has betrayed her. She has done what nobody else would do." Men and women of the city thus lamented and showered numberless abuses on the wicked woman. They burned with terrible agony and sighed. "There can be no hope of life without Rama," they said. The people were disconcerted at the thought of long separation even as aquatic creatures get disturbed when water in which they live begins to fail. Men and women alike were overcome with excessive grief. In the meantime Lord Sri Rama called on His mother (Kausalya). He wore a cheerful look and had fourfold joy in his heart; He no longer feared lest the king should detain him.
