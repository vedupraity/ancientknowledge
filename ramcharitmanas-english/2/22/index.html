                                                            Sri Rama (the Chief of Raghu's line) said, "Laksmana, here is a good descent into the river; now make arrangements for our stay somewhere." Laksmana presently surveyed the north bank of the Payaswini river and said, "Lo! a rivulet bends round this bank like a bow with the river itself for its string, control of the mind and senses and charity for its arrows, and all the sins of the Kali age for its many quarries. Armed with this bow Mount Citrakuta looks like an immovable huntsman who takes unerring aim and makes a frontal attack." With these words Laksmana showed the spot and Sri Rama was delighted to see the site. When the gods learnt that the site had captivated Sri Rama's mind, they proceeded to Citrakuta with Visvakarma, the chief of heavenly architects. They all came in the guise of Kolas and Bhilas and put up beautiful dwellings of leaves and grass. They made a pair of huts which were lovely beyond words, the one a fine little cottage and the other larger in size.

Sri Rama made obeisance to them all and the gods were glad to obtain the reward of their eyes. Raining flowers the heavenly host exclaimed, "Lord, we feel secure today!" With great supplication they described their terrible woes, and returned joyfully to their several abodes. Hermits streamed in as they heard the news that Sri Rama (the Delighter of Raghus) had taken up His abode at Citrakuta. The moon of the solar race fell prostrate when He saw the holy company coming with a cheerful countenance. The hermits pressed Sri Rama (the Chief of Raghu's line) to their bosom and invoked their blessings on Him just in order to see them come true. As they gazed on the beauty of Sita, Laksmana (Sumitra's son) and Rama, they accounted all their spiritual practices fully rewarded.

They stood here and there as so many painted figures, thrilling all over and with tears streaming from their eyes. Sri Rama perceived that they were all overwhelmed with emotion and addressing kind words to them treated them all with honour; while they in their turn greeted the Lord again and again and with joined palms spoke to Him in polite terms:-

You have chosen an excellent spot whereon to take up Your abode; You will be comfortable here during all the seasons. We will render all sorts of services to You keeping away elephants and lions, serpents and tigers. The dreary forest, hills, caves and ravines have all been explored by us foot by foot, O Lord. We will take You for hunting to the different haunts of game and will show You lakes and springs and other reservoirs of water. We and our people are Your servants; therefore, do not hesitate to command us, O Lord."

                                                            Love alone attracts Sri Rama; let those who are curious take note of it. Sri Rama then gratified all the foresters by addressing to them gentle words sweetened by love. Dismissed by Him they bowed their head to Him and departed; and discussing the virtues of the Lord they returned to their respective homes. In this way Sita and the two brothers lived in the forest, delighting the gods and hermits. Ever since the Lord of Raghus came and took up His abode there the forest became a fountain of blessings. Trees of various kinds blossomed and bore fruit and lovely creepers that coiled about them formed an excellent canopy. They were all naturally beautiful like the trees of heaven; it seemed as if the latter had abandoned the celestial groves and migrated to that spot. Strings of bees made an exceedingly sweet humming sound and a delightful breeze breathed soft, cool and fragrant.

Herds of deer were enraptured when they beheld the beauty of Sri Rama roaming about in search of prey. All the forests of gods existing in the universe were filled with envy at the sight of Sri Rama's forest. The heavenly river (Ganga), Saraswati, the Sun-born Yamuna, Narmada (the daughter of Mount Mekala), the blessed Godavari and the various other lakes, seas, streams and rivers, all extolled the Mandakini. The eastern and western hills (from and behind which the sun is believed to emerge and disappear every morning and evening), Mounts Kailasa (the abode of Lord Siva), Mandara, Meru, all abodes of gods, and mountains like the Himalayas, all sang praises of Citrakuta. Glad was the deity presiding over the Vindhya range*, whose delight was more than his heart could contain, to think that he had won such great renown without much exertion.

The forest and hill where that Ocean of Bliss (Sri Rama) took up His abode were naturally lovely; auspicious and the holiest of the holy; how could it be possible to glorify them ? The exquisite beauty of the forest where Sita, Laksmana and Sri Rama came and settled, taking leave of the ocean of milk and bidding adieu to Ayodhya, could not be described even by a hundred thousand Sesas (each with a thousand pairs of tongues). How, then, can I describe it at some length any more than a tortoise living in a puddle can lift Mount Mandara? Laksmana waited upon Sri Rama in thought, word and deed with an amiability and devotion more than one could tell.

                                                            In Sri Rama's company Sita lived a happy life, forgetting Her town (Ayodhya), family and home. Ever watching the moonlike face of Her beloved lord She was extremely glad like the young of a Cakora bird. Finding Her lord's affection grow from day to day She remained happy as a Cakravaka bird during the day. Her mind was so enamoured of Sri Rama's feet that the forest appeared to Her as dear as a thousand Ayodhyas. Dear was the hut of leaves in the company of Her most beloved lord, while fawns and birds constituted Her beloved family. The holy hermits appeared to Her as Her own father-in-law and their spouses as Her mother-in-law; while Her diet consisting of bulbs, roots and fruits tasted like ambrosia. Shared with Her spouse even the lovely litter of leaves delighted Her as hundreds of Cupid's own beds. Can the charm of sensuous enjoyments ever enchant Her whose very look confers the sovereignty of a sphere.

                                                            The Lord of Raghus would do and say only that which would please Sita and Laksmana. He would narrate old legends and stories, to which Laksmana and Sita would listen with great delight. Every time Sri Rama thought of Ayodhya His eyes filled with tears. The gracious Lord became sad when He recalled His father and mother, His family and brothers and particularly the affection, amiability and devotion of Bharata; but He recovered Himself when He realized that the time was unpropitious. Perceiving this, Sita and Laksmana felt distressed even as the shadow of a man behaves just like him. When He saw the condition of His beloved Consort and His brother (Laksmana), the selfpossessed and compassionate Rama, the Delighter of Raghus and the Soother of His devotees heart, began to narrate some sacred legends, hearing which Laksmana and Sita felt relieved.

                                                            The Lord watched over Sita and Laksmana in the same way as the eyelids protect the eyeballs; while Laksmana in his turn waited upon Sita and Sri Rama (the Hero of Raghu's race) just as a fool (who identifies himself with his body) tends his own body. In this way the Lord, who was as friendly to birds and fawns as to gods and ascetics, lived happily in the forest. Thus have I told the delightful story of Sri Rama's journey to the woods; now hear how Sumantra reached Ayodhya. When the Nisada chief returned after escorting the Lord, he saw the minister (Sumantra) with the chariot. The minister was distressed to see the Nisada chief; words fail to describe the agony which he felt at the moment. Crying out "Rama, Rama, Sita, Laksmana" he (Sumantra) dropped on the ground utterly helpless; while the horses kept looking on to the south and neighed. They were as restless as birds shorn of their wings.

You are a man of wisdom and a knower of the highest truth; therefore, compose yourself realizing that Fate is unpropitious to you." Narrating various legends in soft accents, he took him by force and seated him in the chariot. But overpowered by grief he could not drive the chariot; the agony of separation from Rama (the Chief of Raghu's line) was severe in his heart. The horses would not move along the road; they were getting fidgety. It seemed as if wild animals had been caught and put in harness. They would topple down and turn to look behind, torn away from Rama and smarting with deep anguish. If anyone mentioned the name of Rama, Laksmana or Sita, (Janaka's Daughter), they would start neighing and regard him with love. How could anyone describe the anguish of separation the horses felt; they were as restless as a snake robbed of its gem
