Whenever he thought of Śrī Rāma's good nature his feet moved quickly along the way. Bharata's gait at that time resembled the movements of a water-fly carried along a stream.

The natural wealth of the forest grew while Śrī Rāma lived there, even as the people rejoice on securing a good king. The charming forest was the sacred realm referred to here; Discretion was the king (who ruled over it), while Dispassion was his counsellor. Likewise the five Yamas† and the five Niyamas</em> constituted the champions of the realm, Mount Citrakūṭa stood for its capital, while Peace and Good Understanding represented the virtuous and lovely queens.

Shedding their natural animosities they roamed about together like an army complete in all its four limbs.

Uttering the words "Protect me, my lord; save me, my master" he fell flat on the ground like a log, Lakṣmaṇa recognized his loving speech and concluded in his mind that it was Bharata making obeisance.* On the one hand there was the loving affection of an elder brother (Bharata), while, on the other, there was the stronger claim of service to his master. He was, therefore, neither able to meet his brother (Bharata) nor ignore him; some good poet alone could describe Lakṣmaṇa's state of mind. He threw his whole weight on the side of service and remained where he was, even as a kite-flier would pull against a kite that has risen high in the air. Bowing his head to the ground he lovingly said, "Bharata is making obeisance to you, O Lord of Raghus."

The Lord whose Name Itself is a fire to the cotton of sins and whose very thought is the root of all choice blessings, attained purity even as the heavenly stream is consecrated by invoking into it other sacred waters:* such is the verdict of holy men. When two days elapsed after the purification, Śrī Rāma affectionately said to the Guru: "My lord, all the people are sore distressed, living as they do on bulbs, roots, fruits and water alone. When I behold Bharata and his younger brother (Śatrughna), the ministers and all my mothers, every minute that passes seems an age to me. Therefore, pray return to the city with all; for you are here and the king (my father) is in heaven (there is no one to look after the city). I have said too much and all this amounts to gross presumption on my part. Now, my lord, do what is proper." </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> dharma sētu karunāyatana kasa na kahahu asa rāma. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> lōga dukhita dina dui darasa dēkhi lahahu biśrāma..248..

When, however, they heard the auspicious words of the Guru, it seemed as though the wind had turned in their favour. Thrice in the day (in the morning, at noon and in the evening) they bathed in the holy Payasvini river, the very sight of which wipes out hosts of sins, ever feasting their eyes on Śrī Rāma,the incarnation of blessedness, and gladly prostrating themselves before Him again and again. They went out to see the hill and woods hallowed by the presence of Śrī Rāma, where reigned joy of every kind and which was free from all sorrows. Water sweet as nectar flowed from springs; while soft, cool and fragrant breezes soothed every pain of mind and body. Trees, creepers and grasses of infinite variety; fruits, flowers and leaves of many kinds; beautiful slabs of stone and the delightful shade of trees: the splendour of the forest was beyond description. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pb-0"> <div class="box glass animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/37/" > Previous </a> <ul class=pagination-list > <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/1/" > 1 </a> <li> <span class=pagination-ellipsis >…</span> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/37/" > 37 </a> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" disabled > 38 </a> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/39/" > 39 </a> <li> <span class=pagination-ellipsis >…</span> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/49/" > 49 </a> </ul> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/39/" > Next </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box glass animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium is-centered" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-book" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (English)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>2 - Ayodhyā Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a tabindex=-1  href=""> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-quote-right" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part 38</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <section aria-hidden=true  class="section pt-0 animatedParent animateOnce" > <article class="box message is-warning is-small p-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <div class="message-header is-justify-content-center"> <p>Copyright Notice</p> </div> <div class="message-body has-text-centered"> <p > Material used on this page belongs to and copyrighted under Gitapress, Gorakhpur. </p> </div> </article> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
