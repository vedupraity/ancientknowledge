                                                            That day they halted on the bank of the Yamuna; everyone was provided with comforts according to the occasion. In course of the night innumerable boats of untold varieties came from all the ghats. At daybreak the whole party crossed the river in a single trip; everyone was pleased with the services rendered by the Nisada chief in this behalf. After performing their ablutions and bowing their heads to the river (Yamuna) the two brothers (Bharata and Satrughna) resumed their journey with the lord of Nisadas. At the head of the line in chosen vehicles travelled the principal sages (Vamadeva, Vasistha and so on), followed by the royal host. Next followed the two royal brothers, both on foot; their ornaments, costumes and style of dress were all of the very simplest. They were accompanied by their servants, friends and the minister's son and went with their thoughts fixed on Laksmana, Sita and the Lord of Raghus. They lovingly saluted each and every place where Sri Rama had either encamped or rested awhile.

                                                            One woman lovingly said to another, "Friend, can they be Rama and Laksmana or not? Their age, constitution, complexion and comeliness of form are the same, dear companion; their amiability and affection are also similar and their gait too resembles that of Rama and Laksmana. Only their dress is not the same and they are not accompanied by Sita, my friend; and an army complete in its four limbs (viz., horse and foot, elephants and chariots) is marching before them. Moreover, they do not wear a cheerful countenance and their heart is heavy with sorrow. This difference makes me doubt their identity with Rama and Laksmana, O friend." Her argument appealed to the rest of the women; they said, "There is none so clever as she." Applauding the latter and admiring the truth of her remarks another woman spoke in sweet accents. She lovingly narrated the whole episode as to how the festivities in connection with Sri Rama's installation had been obstructed. She then began to praise Bharata's amiability, affection, genial disposition and goodluck.

                                                            Bharata's brotherly affection, devotion and conduct dispel the woes and evil of those who talk or hear of them. Whatever may be said with regard to them, dear friend, will be quite inadequate; it is no wonder that a brother of Rama should be like that. All of us who have seen Bharata and his younger brother have become praiseworthy among women." Hearing of his virtues and seeing his forlorn state they lamented, "Surely he is not a fit son for such a vile mother as Kaikeyi." Someone said, "The queen-mother (Kaikeyi) is not to blame at all; all this has been accomplished by God, who is so favourably disposed to us. Of what account are we, vile women, excluded both from secular and Vedic rites and impure by birth as well as by doings, who dwell in an accursed region (woodland) and in a wretched village and are the worst of our class, that we should have such a sight, which is a reward of great religious merit?" There was a similar rejoicing and wonder in every village: it seemed as if a celestial tree had sprung up in a desert.

                                                            Hearing his own praises as well as of Sri Rama's virtues Bharata went on his way, thinking of Sri Rama. Whenever he happened to see holy waters he bathed in them and whenever he caught sight of a hermitage or a temple he made obeisance to it, asking in his heart only one boon, viz., devotion to the lotus-feet of Sita and Rama. Whomsoever he met, be he a Kola or any other forester or even if he were an anchorite, a religious student, a recluse or a hermit, he would salute him and enquire in which part of the forest were Laksmana, Rama and Videha's daughter (Sita). They told him all the news of the Lord and at the sight of Bharata obtained the reward of their life. Those persons who said they had seen the Lord doing well were counted as dear as Sri Rama and Laksmana themselves. Thus in polite phrases he would make enquiries from all and hear the story of Sri Rama's forest life.

Bharata and his whole host rejoiced at the thought that they would be able to see Sri Rama and the sting of their sorrows would come to an end. Each indulged in his own fancy and all went intoxicated with the wine of love; their limbs were getting out of control, their legs tottered and they spoke words in an incoherent way due to emotion. Sri Rama's friend (Guha) presently pointed to Bharata the crest-jewel of mountains (Kamadagiri), which was naturally charming and in the vicinity of which on the bank of the river Payasvini dwelt the two brothers (Sri Rama and Laksmana) alongwith Sita. Catching sight of the mountain all fell prostrate on the ground with the cries of "Glory to Sri Rama, the life of Janaka's daughter!" The royal host was so overwhelmed with emotion as though the Chief of Raghu's line had turned back towards Ayodhya.

Perceiving a suitable site and water close by they halted and at the close of night the beloved of Sri Rama resumed his journey. There Sri Rama awoke while it was yet dark. Sita saw in a dream that very night as if Bharata had come with his retinue and that his body was tormented by the agony of separation from his lord. All who had accompanied him were sad at heart, miserable and afflicted; while Her mothers-in-law She found changed in appearance. On hearing of Sita's dream Sri Rama's eyes filled with tears and He who rids others of their sorrow became sorrowful. "This dream, Laksmana, bodes no good; somebody will break terribly bad news." Saying so He took His bath with His brother and worshipping the Enemy of Tripura, Lord Siva, paid His respects to holy men
