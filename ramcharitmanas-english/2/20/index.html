Accompanied by Sita the two brothers gladly proceeded further, extolling the daughter of the sun-god as they went. Many a traveller met them on the way and beholding the two brothers they fondly exclaimed: "Finding all the marks of royalty on your person, we are sore troubled at heart. When you wend your way on foot, the science of astrology (which tells us that men possessing such and such features should always be borne on some vehicle) is misleading to our mind. The road is difficult and lies through big mountains and forests. On top of it you have a delicate girl with you. Infested with elephants and lions the forest is too terrible to look at. We are ready to accompany you if you enjoin us to do so. We will escort you as far as you go and will then return bowing our heads to you."

The deities presiding over these towns said to one another: "By what blessed soul and at what auspicious hour were these hamlets and villages founded? They are so lucky, meritorious and of such exquisite beauty!" Even Amaravati (the city of immortals) stood no comparison with the spots which were trodden by Sri Rama's feet. The dwellers on the wayside were all embodiments of virtue; they evoked the praise of the denizens of heaven inasmuch as they feasted their eyes on Sri Rama, who was dark as a cloud, as well as on Sita and Laksmana. The lakes and streams in which Sri Rama bathed were the envy of the lakes and rivers of gods. The tree under which the Lord sat was glorified by the trees of paradise. Nay, kissing the dust of Sri Rama's lotusfeet Earth deemed herself most lucky.

Beholding the beauty of Sri Rama, Laksmana and Sita they obtained the reward of their eyes and felt gratified. Their eyes were wet with tears, a thrill ran through their body and they were all enraptured to behold the two brothers. The state of their mind could not be described in words; it seemed as if paupers had stumbled on a pile of heavenly gems. Calling their neighbours they admonished one another: "Obtain the reward of your eyes this very moment." Some were enraptured to see Rama and went with Him gazing on Him all the time. Others took His image into the heart through the door of their eyes and were utterly overpowered in body, mind and speech.

Hearing their agreeable words and seeing their extreme love, the tender-hearted and most amiable Sri Rama mentally perceived that Sita was fatigued, and rested awhile in the shade of the banyan tree. Men and women regarded His loveliness with great delight; His peerless beauty captivated their eyes and mind. Standing in a circle with their gaze fixed on the countenance of Sri Ramacandra they all shone like a group of Cakora birds encircling the moon. With His graceful form possessing the hue of a young Tamala tree He fascinated by His looks the mind of a million Cupids. Laksmana too, who had fair limbs bright as lightning and charming from head to foot, appeared most lovely and attracted the mind. With the bark of trees wrapped round their loins and a quiver fastened to their waist the two brothers carried a bow and arrow in their lotus hands.

Everyone gazed on the beauty of Sri Rama, Laksmana and Sita with their mind, intellect and reason fully absorbed. Thirsting for love the villagers, both men and women, stood motionless even as bucks and does are dazed by light. The village women approached Sita; in their extreme love they would put questions to Her but hesitated to do so. Again and again they threw themselves at Her feet and addressed to Her soft and guileless words which came straight from their heart: "Princess, we have a request to make to you, but due to our womanly modesty we are afraid to ask you. Forgive our incivility, madam, and be not offended, knowing that we are after all rustic women. Both these princes are naturally graceful in form; it is from them that emerald and gold have borrowed their green and yellow lustre respectively."

Hearing their loving and sweet words Sita felt abashed and smiled within Herself. Looking at them in the first instance She then cast Her eyes towards the earth; the fair-complexioned lady felt a twofold delicacy. With a voice sweet as the notes of a cuckoo the fawn-eyed princess bashfully replied in loving and sweet accents: "The one who is artless in manners and has a fair and graceful form is called Laksmana and is my younger brother-in-law." Again veiling Her moon-like face with an end of Her sari She looked at Her beloved lord and then bending Her eyebrows and casting a sidelong glance with Her beautiful eyes that resembled the Khanjana bird (a species of wagtail) in their quick movements, She indicated to them by signs that He was Her husband. All the village women were as delighted as paupers that had been allowed free access to hoards of riches.

Again and again we pray with joined palms: should you return by this very route, allow us to see you, remembering us as your handmaids." Sita found them all athirst with love and comforted them with many soothing words even as lilies are refreshed by moonlight. Presently, reading Sri Rama's mind, Laksmana gently asked the villagers about the road they should take. The moment they heard this the villagers, both men and women, became sad; a thrill ran through their body and tears rushed to their eyes. Their joy disappeared and they felt depressed at heart as though God was snatching back the treasure He had bestowed upon them. Reflecting on the ways of Fate they took courage and fixing upon the easiest road they gave it out to Him.

Some people remarked: "Naturally charming as they are, these princes must have appeared on earth of their own accord and were not made by God. In all the fourteen spheres ransack if you will the entire range of God's creation described at length in the Vedas as perceptible by the ears, eyes and mind; but where can you find such a man and such a woman as these? At their very sight Brahma's mind got enamoured of them and he proceeded to make their match. He toiled much, but none of his products could even approach the prototype; and due to that jealousy he has brought these princes to the woods and hid them." Others said, "We do not claim to know much, but account ourselves supremely blessed. They too are meritorious in our opinion, who see these princes or have seen them or shall see them.

Reflecting on the tender lotus-like feet of the princes and the rough road they were required to tread, the women said in polite phrase with their heart stirred with deep feeling, "At the touch of their soft and rosy soles the earth shrinks even as our hearts. If the Lord of the universe chose to exile them into the woods, why did He not at the same time strew their path with flowers? If we can secure from Heaven the boon of our asking, let us keep these princes, O friend, within the lids of our eyes." Those men and women, who did not come in time, were unable to behold Sita and Rama. Hearing of their exquisite beauty they anxiously asked: "How far, brother, must have they gone by now?" The stronger of them ran on and saw the princes, and returned triumphant, attaining the end of their existence

                                                            In every village there was similar rejoicing at the sight of Sri Rama, who was a moon to the lily-like solar race. Those who could get some information as to the circumstances that had led to Sri Rama's banishment blamed the king and queen. Others said, "The king is too benevolent in that he has vouchsafed to us the reward of our eyes." Men and women talked among themselves in straight, loving and agreeable phrases. "Blessed are the parents who gave birth to these princes; and happy the town from which they hail. Happy is the land, hill, forest, village and every spot which they visit. Nay, the Creator must have felt happy in creating him who looks upon these princes as his near and dear ones." The delightful story as to how Sri Rama and Laksmana travelled in the woods was broadcast all along the route and throughout the forest.

                                                            Sri Rama walked in front while Laksmana followed in the rear, both conspicuous in the robes of ascetics. Between the two Sita shone like Maya (the Divine Energy) that stands between Brahma (God), on the one hand, and the individual soul on the other. To illustrate Her beauty as it exists in my mind in another way, She looked like Rati (the wife of the god of love) shining between Madhu (the spirit presiding over the vernal season) and the god of love. Beating my brains for another illustration, let me say She shone like Rohini* between Budha† and the moon-god. Sita trod on the path with meticulous care planting Her feet in the space between Her lord's footprints. Avoiding the footprints both of Sita and Rama, Laksmana traversed the road always keeping them to his right. The ideal affection of Sri Rama, Laksmana and Sita was past telling; how can one describe it? Even birds and beasts were enraptured to behold their beauty; their hearts were stolen by Rama, the wayfarer.

Then perceiving that Sita was tired and seeing a banyan tree and cool water hard by, the Hero of Raghu's line partook of bulbs, roots and fruits and staying there overnight and bathing at dawn the Lord of Raghus proceeded further. And beholding lovely woods, lakes and hills the Lord reached the hermitage of Valmiki. Sri Rama saw the sage's beautiful dwelling with its charming hills and forest and its sacred waters. The lotuses in the ponds and the trees in the woods were in blossom; intoxicated with their honey bees sweetly hummed over them. Birds and beasts made a tumultuous noise and moved about in joy free from all animosities.
