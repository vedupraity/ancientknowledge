Raising a jubilant cry of applause the gods extolled him and rained flowers on him. "This man is low in the eyes of the world as well as from the point of view of the Vedas, so much so that one must bathe even on crossing his shadow. Yet Śrī Rāma's younger brother, Bharata, has met him in close embrace, his body thrilling all over with joy. Hosts of sins turn away from them who utter the name of Rāma even while yawning. As for this man he was embraced by Śrī Rāma Himself, who thereby bestowed on him and his family the efficacy of sanctifying the whole world. Where the water of the Karmanāśā joins the celestial stream (the Gaṅgā) tell me who would not place it on his head ! The whole world knows how Vālmīki became as good as Brahma (God Himself) by repeating the name (Rāma) in the reverse way (as Mara).

In this way the gods glorified Śrī Rāma's name and the people of Ayodhyā rejoiced as they heard the praise. Having thus met Śrī Rāma's friend (Guha), Bharata lovingly enquired after his health, welfare and happiness. Seeing Bharata's amiability and affection on that occasion the Nisada forgot all about himself. His bashfulness, love and soul's delight grew; and he stood gazing at Bharata with unwinking eyes. Collecting himself he bowed at Bharata's feet again and with joined palms lovingly submitted, "Now that I have beheld your lotus feet, which are the very fountain of happiness, I have accounted myself blessed for all time. And now, my lord, by your supreme grace my welfare is assured for millions of generations.

Seeing his affection and hearing his humble submission Bharata's younger brother, Śatrughna, embraced him next. The Nisada chief then greeted all the dowager queens in polite and respectful terms, mentioning his name each time. Treating him on the same footing as Lakṣmaṇa they gave him their blessing: May you live happily for millions of years. The men and women of the city were as glad to see the Nisada chief as if they saw Lakṣmaṇa, and said, "He has surely reaped the reward of his existence in that our beloved Rāma folded him in his arms." Hearing them extol his good fortune the Nisada chief led them with a cheerful heart.

                                                            When Bharata beheld the town of Srngaverapura, all his limbs were overpowered with emotion. Leaning on the Nisada chief he presented a goodly sight; it appeared as if meekness and love had taken a living form. In this way Bharata with all his army went and saw the stream of the Gaṅgā, which purifies the whole world. He made obeisance to the ghat where Śrī Rāma had bathed and said His prayers; and his soul was a enraptured as if he had met Śrī Rāma Himself. The men and women of the city bowed low; they were glad to see the divine stream. Taking a dip into the river they begged with joined palms to be favoured with abundant love for Śrī Ramacandra's feet. Bharata exclaimed, "Mother Gaṅgā! your sands are delightful to all and the very cow of plenty to your devotees. With joined palms, therefore, I ask of you only one boon; viz., spontaneous love for the feet of Sītā and Śrī Rāma."

After worshipping the gods and taking leave of them the two brothers (Bharata and Śatrughna) went up to Śrī Rāma's mother (Kausalyā). Bharata showed respect to all his mothers by kneading their feet and speaking to each in polite terms. Then entrusting his brother with the service of his mothers he himself summoned the Nisada chief and went hand in hand with him, his body overpowered with excess of love.

He also placed the dust of Śrī Rāma's footprints on his eyes with an excess of love which could not be described in words. He saw there a few gold spangles, which he placed on his head and treated them on a par with Sītā. With tears in his eyes and a heart full of remorse he spoke to his friend in sweet accents: "These spangles have lost their charm and appear lustreless due to their separation from Sītā, even as the people of Ayodhyā, both men and women, are spent through sorrow. To whom shall I liken her father, Janaka, who in this world is a master of asceticism and enjoyment both? And she had for her father-in-law King Daśaratha, the sun of the solar race, who was the envy even of the lord of paradise (Indra). And her beloved lord is no other than Lord Śrī Rāma, from whose glory all great ones derive their greatness!

                                                            And my younger brother, Lakṣmaṇa, is so comely and worth fondling; never was there such a brother, nor is there, nor will be. Beloved of the people and the darling of his parents, he is dear as life to both Sītā and the Hero of Raghu's line. Nay, he is so delicate of frame and tender of disposition and his body has never been exposed to hot winds; yet he is bearing hardships of every kind in the woods. Oh! my breast has outdone millions of thunderbolts. As for Śrī Rāma he has illumined the world by being born in it; he is such an ocean of beauty, amiability, joy and all excellences. Śrī Rāma's disposition is the delight of the people of Ayodhyā and his own family, much more of his preceptor and parents. Even enemies praise Śrī Rāma, who steals the heart by his polite speech, agreeable manners and modesty of behaviour. Millions of Saradas (goddesses of speech) and hundreds of millions of Śeṣas (serpent-gods) are unable to reckon up the virtues of the Lord."

                                                            Śrī Rāma had never heard any mention of sorrow; the king (our father) tended him like the tree of life. Nay, all the mothers cherished him day and night even as the eyelids protect the eyes or a serpent guards the gem on its head. The same Rāma now wanders through the forest on foot living on bulbs, roots, fruits and flowers. Accursed is Kaikeyī (my mother), the root of evil, who turned hostile to him (her own husband) who was the dearest object of her life. And twice accursed is my own wretched self, the ocean of sin and the occasion of all trouble. While God created me as a blot on my family, my wicked mother has made me the enemy of my master." Hearing this the Nisada chief lovingly comforted him: "Why should you lament in vain? Śrī Rāma is dear to you, and you are dear to Rāma: this is a settled fact, and the blame rests with an adverse fate.

There is no one, says Tulasīdāsa, so supremely dear to Śrī Rāma as you are: I declare this on oath. Therefore, be assured that all will be well in the end and take courage in your heart."

On receiving this news the men and women of the city sallied forth to see the place (where Śrī Rāma had slept one night) much distressed at heart. Pacing round the spot clockwise they made obeisance to it and blamed Kaikeyī to their heart's content. Tears rushed to their eyes again and again and they reproached cruel Fate. Some would praise Bharata's love, while others said the king had vindicated his affection. They would reproach themselves and praise the Nisada chief; who can describe their confusion and woe? In this way they all kept vigil overnight and at daybreak the passage across the river began. The Guru was put on a good and handsome boat, and all the mothers on another newly-built one.

                                                            He made the Nisada chief lead the van and then started the palanquins carrying the queen-mothers, and summoning his younger brother (Śatrughna) told him off as their escort. The Guru proceeded next alongwith the other Brāhmaṇas. He himself then made obeisance to the celestial river, invoked Sītā, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa and set forth on foot; while riding horses meant for the king were led by the bridle alongwith him. Again and again his faithful servants said, "Be pleased, sire,to mount your horse." "Śrī Rāma has gone on foot; while chariots, elephants and horses are intended for me! What behoves me is that I should walk on my head; for the duty of a servant is harder than any other duty." Seeing his behaviour and hearing his polite speech all his servants melted out of a feeling of self-disparagement.
