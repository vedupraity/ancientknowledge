                                                            One day the Chief of Raghus sat with all his court in the state assembly hall. Himself the embodiment of all virtues, the king was overjoyed to hear of Śrī Rāma's fair renown. Every monarch solicited his favour, and the very guardians of the world cultivated his friendship while respecting his wishes. In all the three spheres of the universe and in all time-past, present or future-none could be found so abundantly blessed as Daśaratha. Of him who had for his son Rāma, the root of all bliss, whatever might be said would fall short of the truth. The king casually took a mirror in his hand and looking at his face in the mirror, set his crown straight. The hair beside his ears had turned grey; it seemed as if old age were whispering into his ears, "O king, make Rāma your regent and thereby realize the object of your life and birth in this world."

Servants and ministers, nay, all the people of the city and others who are either my enemies or friends or neutrals hold Rāma as dear as I do. It seems your benediction itself has incarnated in his lovely form. What more, my lord, all the Brāhmaṇas and their families cherish the same love for him as you do. Those who place on their head the dust from the Guru's feet acquire mastery as it were over all fortune. No one has realized it as I have done; I have obtained everything by adoring the holy dust from your feet. Now there remains only one longing in my heart and that too will be realized by your grace, my lord." The sage was delighted to perceive his artless devotion and said, "O king, give me your commands."

Let this happy event take place during my life-time so that all people may attain the reward of their eyesight. By the Lord's blessing Śiva has allowed everything to pass smoothly; this is the only longing that I have in my mind. Then I will not mind whether this body survives or not, so that I may not have to repent afterwards." The sage was pleased to hear these agreeable words of Daśaratha, which were the very fountain of felicity and joy. He said, "Listen, O king: aversion to Śrī Rāma makes one repent, while His adoration is the only means of soothing the agony of one's heart; nay, He follows like a shadow where there is unadulterated love; the same Lord Śrī Rāma has been born as a son to you."

They bowed their heads saying, "Victory to you may you live long;" and the king placed before them the most auspicious proposal. "If this proposal finds favour with you all, instal Śrī Rāma on the throne with a cheerful heart." The counsellors were glad to hear these agreeable words, which fell like a shower on the young plant of their desire. The ministers prayed with joined palms: "May you continue to live for millions of years, O sovereign of the world. You have thought out a good plan which is a source of happiness to the whole world; therefore, lord, make haste and lose no time." The king was pleased to hear the encouraging words of the ministers; it looked as if a growing creeper had obtained the support of a strong bough.

And then he enumerated by name a number of auspicious objects such as herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, leaves, chowries, deerskins, and draperies of various kinds including countless varieties of woollen and silken textiles, jewels and numerous other articles of good omen which were considered useful in this world for the coronation of a king. Detailing all the procedure laid down in the Vedas he said, "Erect canopies of all sorts in the city and transplant in the streets on all sides trees of the mango, arecanut and plantain with fruits. Paint beautiful designs on the floors filling them with costly jewels and tell the people to decorate the bazar promptly. Worship Lord Gaṇeśa and your preceptor as well as the tutelary deity and render service in every form to the Brāhmaṇas, the very gods on earth."

The king adored Brāhmaṇas, holy men and gods, and performed auspicious rites for the sake of Śrī Rāma's welfare. As soon as the delightful news of Śrī Rāma's installation reached the ears of the people, the whole of Ayodhyā resounded with festal music. Good omens manifested themselves in the person of Śrī Rāma and Sītā; Their graceful lucky limbs began to throb. Experiencing a thrill of joy they lovingly said to one another, "The omens prognosticate Bharata's return. Many days have passed and our heart longs to meet him. Auspicious omens assure us of our meeting with a beloved friend, and in this world there is no one so dear to us as Bharata; the good omens can thus have but one meaning." Śrī Rāma anxiously remembered His half-brother (Bharata) day and night, even as a turtle has its heart fixed on its eggs.

With their body thrilling over with emotion and heart full of rapture all the queens started preparing festal vases. Queen Sumitrā painted with coloured meal lovely diagrams in various charming designs and filled them with jewels. Overwhelmed with delight Śrī Rāma's mother (Kausalyā) summoned the Brāhmaṇas and loaded them with gifts. She worshipped village deities and other gods and Nāgas and vowing them further offerings said to them, "In your mercy grant me a boon which may ensure Śrī Rāma's welfare." Moon-faced and fawn- eyed ladies sang festal strains in a voice as sweet as the notes of a cuckoo.

The moment the Lord of Raghus, Śrī Rāma, heard of the Guru's arrival, He repaired to the door and, bowed His head at his feet. Reverently offering him water to wash his hands with He ushered the sage and paid him honour by worshipping him in the sixteen prescribed modes.* Then clasping his feet with Sītā, Śrī Rāma spoke with His lotus palms joined in prayer, "A master's visit to his servant's house is the root of all blessings and a panacea for all evils; yet it would have been more fitting, my lord, for the master to have lovingly sent for the servant and charged him with a duty; for such is the right course. Since, however, my lord has laid aside his authority and showed his affection to me (by calling on me) my house has been hallowed today. I am ready to do what I am bid, holy sir; for a servant is benefited only by serving his master."

Rāma, You should observe religious austerity today so that God may bring this affair to a happy conclusion." Having admonished Him in this way the Guru returned to the king; while Śrī Rāma felt uneasy in His heart and said to Himself, "My brothers and myself were all born together and together have we dined, slept and played in our childhood; the piercing of our ear-lobes, (one of the sixteen sacraments incumbent on a Hindu), our investiture with the sacred thread, wedding and all other ceremonies have been gone through together. The only unseemly practice in this spotless line is that the eldest should be installed on the throne to the exclusion of his younger brothers." May this loving and graceful expression of regret on the part of the Lord drive away all suspicion from the mind of His devotees.

All prayed for Bharata's return (from his maternal uncle's) and said to one another, "Would that Bharata came with expedition and obtained the reward of his eyes." In every bazar, street, house, lane and place of resort men and women talked to one another, "When will that blessed hour start tomorow; during which God will fulfil our desire, when with Sītā beside Him Śrī Rāma will take His seat on the throne of gold and when the object of our desire will be accomplished?" They all said, "When will the morrow come?" While the wicked gods prayed that some trouble might brew in the meantime. The rejoicing that was going on in Ayodhyā did not please them even as a moonlit night is not liked by a thief. Invoking Śāradā the gods supplicated her and laying hold of her feet fell at them again and again.

                                                            Hearing this prayer of the divinities goddess Śāradā stood still and was grieved at the thought that she was going to play the same role with reference to the people of Ayodhyā as a wintry night does with respect to a bed of lotuses. Seeing her downcast the gods spoke again in a suppliant tone, "Mother, not the least blame will attach to you; for the Lord of Raghus is above sorrow and joy alike. You are fully acquainted with Śrī Rāma's glory. As for the people, every embodied soul is subject to pleasure and pain according to its fate. Therefore, you should go to Ayodhyā for the good of the celestials." Clasping her feet again and again they exerted great pressure on her till she yielded and set out, considering the gods as mean-minded. She said to herself, "Though their abode is on high, their doings are mean; they cannot see others prosperity." Again, reflecting on the role she was destined to perform in the days to come, when worthy poets would seek her favour, she came with a cheerful heart to the capital of Daśaratha like the intolerably evil influence of a planet.
