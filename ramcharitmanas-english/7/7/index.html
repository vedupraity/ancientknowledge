The two brothers derived much joy from the discourse on His immaculate virtues and with much entreaty had it repeated again and again.

First I enumerate at length those to whom it caused sorrow. To begin with, the night of ignorance terminated; the owl-like sins hid themselves wherever they could; the white lily in the shape of lust and anger closed. Cakora birds in the shape of activities of various kinds, the phenomenal existence, Time and Nature never rejoiced; thieves like jealousy, pride, infatuation and arrogance had no occasion to display their skill in any quarter; lotuses of every description in the shape of knowledge and realization opened in the pond of piety.

Finding it a good opportunity the sage Sanaka* and his three brothers (Sanandana, Sanātana and Sanatkumāra) arrived there. They were all embodiments of spiritual glow, adorned with amiability and other noble qualities and constantly absorbed in the ecstasy of union with Brahma; though infants to all appearance, they are aeons old. The sages looked upon all with the same eye and were above all diversity; it seemed as if the four Vedas had each assumed a bodily form. They had no covering on their body except the quarters; and their only hobby was to hear the recital of Śrī Rāma's exploits wherever it was carried on. Sanaka and his brothers, O Bhavānī, (continues Lord Śiva,) had stayed in the hermitage of the enlightened sage Agastya and the noble sage had narrated to them many a story relating to Śrī Rāma, which are productive of wisdom in the same way as the friction of two pieces of wood produces fire. </p> </div> <ul class=mb-5  > <li class=has-text-justified  > <strong>*</strong> The sage Sanaka and his three brothers are the first progeny of Brahmā during the present creation, and therefore the eldest of all creation.

The Lord in His turn bowed His head with joined palms. When the Hero of Raghu's line perceived their condition, His eyes too streamed with tears and every hair on His body stood on its end. Taking them by the hand, the Lord seated them and addressed them in most charming words : "Listen, great sages: I am indeed blessed today. By your very sight all one's sins are wiped out.
