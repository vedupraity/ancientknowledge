The thought of His marvellous form, which stole the heart of sages, filled the mother with joy. His body was dark as a cloud, the delight of all eyes; in His four arms He bore His characteristic emblems (a conch-shell, a discus, a club and a lotus). Adorned with jewels and a garland of sylvan flowers and endowed with large eyes, the Slayer of the demon Khara was an ocean of beauty. Joining both her palms the mother said, "O infinite Lord, how can I praise You! The Vedas as well as the Purāṇas declare You as transcending Māyā, beyond attributes, above knowledge and beyond all measure. He who is sung by the Vedas and holy men as an ocean of mercy and bliss and the repository of all virtues, the same Lord of Lakṣmī, the lover of His devotees, has revealed Himself for my good. The Vedas proclaim that every pore of Your body contains multitudes of universes brought forth by Māyā. That such a Lord stayed in my womb-this amusing story staggers the mind of even men of wisdom." When the revelation came upon the mother, the Lord smiled; He would perform many a sportive act. Therefore He exhorted her by telling her the charming account of her previous birth so that she might love Him as her own child. The mother's mind was changed; she spoke again, "Give up this superhuman form and indulge in childish sports, which are so dear to a mother's heart; the joy that comes from such sports is unequalled in everyway." Hearing these words the all-wise Lord of immortals became an infant and began to cry. Those who sing this lay (says Tulasīdāsa) attain to the abode of Śrī Hari and never fall into the well of mundane existence. </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> bipra dhēnu sura saṃta hita līnha manuja avatāra. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> nija icchā nirmita tanu māyā guna gō pāra..192..

With a mind saturated with the highest love and with a body thrilling all over with joy he sought to rise, while attempting to recover his senses."The same Lord, whose very Name brings blessings with It even when It reaches one's ears, has arrived at my house," he said to himself; and the thought filled his mind with supreme joy. Sending for musicians he said, "Play on your instruments."The preceptor Vasistha was also summoned and he called at the palace door, with a train of Brāhmaṇas.

Proficient in learning and perfect in politeness, virtues and decorum, they played all the games imitating the role of a king. With an arrow and bow in the hands of each they appeared most charming; their beauty enraptured the whole creation, both animate and inanimate. Through whichever street the four brothers passed in pursuit of their sport, all the men and women there stood motionless on perceiving them. </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> kōsalapura bāsī nara nāri bṛddha aru bāla. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> prānahu tē priya lāgata saba kahu rāma kṛpāla..204..

He would deliberately kill only holy game and brought and showed the daily bag to the king. The beasts that were killed by Śrī Rāma's shaft went straight to heaven after death. He took His meals with His younger brothers and companions and obeyed the orders of His parents. He would always contrive means to delight the people of the city. He would listen to the Vedas and Purāṇas with rapt attention and would Himself expound the truths contained therein to His younger brothers. Rising at break of day the Lord of Raghus would bow His head to His parents and preceptor and, obtaining their permission, busied Himself with the affairs of the city. The king was glad at heart to see His noble acts. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pb-0"> <div class="box glass animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/1/37/" > Previous </a> <ul class=pagination-list > <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/1/1/" > 1 </a> <li> <span class=pagination-ellipsis >…</span> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/1/37/" > 37 </a> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" disabled > 38 </a> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/1/39/" > 39 </a> <li> <span class=pagination-ellipsis >…</span> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/1/58/" > 58 </a> </ul> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/1/39/" > Next </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box glass animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium is-centered" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-book" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (English)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/1/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>1 - Baal Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a tabindex=-1  href=""> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-quote-right" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part 38</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <section aria-hidden=true  class="section pt-0 animatedParent animateOnce" > <article class="box message is-warning is-small p-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <div class="message-header is-justify-content-center"> <p>Copyright Notice</p> </div> <div class="message-body has-text-centered"> <p > Material used on this page belongs to and copyrighted under Gitapress, Gorakhpur. </p> </div> </article> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
