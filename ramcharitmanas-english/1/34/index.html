The son got up and bowed to the commands of his father. In this way Rāvaṇa ordered all and himself sallied forth, club in hand. Even as the ten-headed Rāvaṇa marched, the earth shook and at his thundering call the spouses of gods miscarried. Hearing of Rāvaṇa's angry approach the gods themselves sought the caves of Mount Sumeru. When the ten-faced Rāvaṇa invaded the beautiful realms of the guardians of the ten quarters, he found them all desolate. Again and again he roared loudly like a lion and, challenging the gods to battle, scoffed at them. Mad with lust of blood he traversed the whole world in search of a combatant; but nowhere could he find anyone.The sun-god, the moon-god, the wind-god, the god of water, the gods of wealth and fire, the gods of time and death and all other gods entrusted with the governance of the world. Kiṁnaras, Siddhas, men, gods and Nāgas, all were wilfully harassed by him. All embodied beings in the creation of Brahma, whether men or women, submitted to Rāvaṇa's will. All did his bidding out of fear and always bowed suppliantly at his feet. </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> bhujabala bisva basya kari rākhēsi kōu na sutaṃtra. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> maṃḍalīka mani rāvana rāja karai nija maṃtra..182ka..

They acted in everyway contrary to Veda and did everything in their power to eradicate religion. Wherever they found a cow or a Brāhmaṇa they set fire to that city, town or village. Virtuous acts were nowhere to be seen. No one paid any respect to the gods, the Brāhmaṇas and the spiritual preceptor.
