When he read the auspicious marks on her body, he was lost in reverie. He was gladdened at heart, but he would not openly mention the happy characteristics. "He who weds this girl," he said to himself, "Shall become immortal; and no one shall be able to conquer him in battle. He whom Śīlanidhi's daughter selects for her lord shall be adored by the entire creation, both animate and inanimate." Having read these characteristics the sage kept them to himself, and mentioned a few fabricated ones to the king. Telling the king that his daughter was of good promise, Nārada left. He thought within himself, "Let me devise and try some means whereby the princess may choose me for her husband." He had no more zeal to practise Japa (muttering of sacred formulas) or austerity. "Good God, how am I to get the girl?" he said to himself. </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> ēhi avasara cāhia parama sōbhā rūpa bisāla. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> jō bilōki rījhai kuaomri taba mēlai jayamāla..131..

Yet I have no such friend as Hari; let Him, therefore, come to my rescue at this juncture." Then Nārada prayed in manifold ways and lo! The sportive and merciful Lord appeared before him. The sight was soothing to the sage's eyes. He was glad at heart and felt assured that his object would be accomplished. In great humility he told the Lord all that had happened, and said, "Be gracious to me and be good enough to help me. Lord, bestow on me Your own beauty; in no other way can I get possession of her. Speedily do that which may serve my best interests; I am Your own servant, my lord."

In a like manner I have resolved on doing what is good to you." So saying, the Lord disappeared. Under the spell of His Māyā the sage was so mystified that he could not understand even such unambiguous words of Śrī Hari. The chief of seers hastened to the spot where the arena for the choice-marriage had been prepared. Richly adorned, the royal suitors had occupied their respective seats, each with his retinue. The sage was glad at heart; for he thought within himself, "My beauty is so surpassing that the princess will never commit the error of choosing for her husband anyone else than me." In the sage's own interest the gracious Lord had made him hideous beyond description. But no one could mark the change that had taken place in him; everyone knew him to be Nārada and greeted him as such. </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> rahē tahāom dui rudra gana tē jānahiṃ saba bhēu. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> biprabēṣa dēkhata phirahiṃ parama kautukī tēu..133..

The sage was under a spell of delusion; for his heart had been stolen by love. The attendants of Śiva felt amused at this and greatly enjoyed the fun. Even though the sage heard their ironical talk, he could not follow it, his reason being clouded by infatuation. No one perceived this extra-ordinary phenomenon; the princess alone saw his ugly form.

The Lord of Lakṣmī carried off the bride to the despair of all assembled kings. The sage felt much perturbed; for infatuation had robbed the sage of his reason. He felt as if a gem had dropped from a loosened knot in the end of his garment. The attendants of Hara then smilingly said, "Just look at your face in a mirror." Uttering these words both ran away in great alarm and the sage looked at his reflection in water.

He was accompanied by Goddess Rāma and the princess referred to above. The lord of immortals spoke in gentle tones, "To what destination, holy sir, are you betaking yourself like one distracted?" As soon as he heard these words Nārada was filled with rage. Dominated as he was by Māyā, there was no reason left in him. He said, "You cannot bear to look upon the good fortune of others.
