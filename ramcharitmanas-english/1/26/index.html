He had serpents for His ear-rings and bracelets, smeared His person with ashes and wrapped a lion's skin round His loins. He bore the crescent on His charming aest and the river Gaṅgā on the crown of His head and had three eyes and a serpent for the sacred thread. His throat was black with the poison swallowed by him at the beginning of creation and had a wreath of human skulls about His neck. Thus clad in a ghastly attire, He was nonetheless an embodiment of blessings and merciful to the core. A trident and a œamarµu (a shall drum shaped like an hour-glass) adorned His hands. Śiva rode on a bull while musical instruments played. Female divinities smiled to see Him. "The world has no bride worthy of the bridegroom," They said to one another. Viṣṇu, Brahmā and hosts of other gods joined the bridegroom's procession and rode on their respective vehicles. The gathering of the immortals was incomparable in every respect; the procession, however, was hardly worthy of the bridegroom. (1-4)

Hearing the words of Viṣṇu, the gods smiled and parted, each with his own group. The great Lord Śiva laughed in His sleeves and noticed that Śrī Hari's humour never failed. As soon as He heard these most pleasing remarks of His beloved friend, He sent Bhr̥ṅgī to call all His attendants. And they all came when they heard Śiva's command and bowed their head at the lotus feet of their lord. Śiva laughed to see His host in their motley attire riding every kind of vehicle. Some were headless, while others were hydra-headed monsters; some were without hands and feet, while others had numerous hands and feet. Some had numerous eyes, while others had no eyes at all; some were stout and well-built, while others had very slim bodies. (1-4)

                                                            The procession was now quite worthy of the bridegroom; the processionists indulged in gaieties of various kinds as they went along. On the other side Himācala erected a most wonderful pavilion which beggared description. As many mountains as existed in the world, small or big, more than man can count, and the whole host of woods, seas, rivers and ponds* were all invited by Himācala. Capable of taking any form they liked, they assumed handsome figures and repaired to the house of Himālaya alongwith their retinues and fair consorts. They all sang festive songs out of affection. The mountain-king had already caused a number of houses to be tastefully decorated; all the guests were lodged therein, each occupying a house befitting one's status. The splendour of the city was so captivating that after a glance at it the creative skill of Brahmā himself looked very small. (1-4)

Groves and gardens, wells and ponds and rivers, all looked charming beyond words. Every house was decorated with a number of triumphal arches, flags and buntings. Men and women of the city were so lovely and ingenious that they enraptured the hearts even of sages.

Adorning themselves and decorating their vehicles of various kinds, a party proceeded in advance to receive the procession with due honour. They were gladdened at heart to see the gathering of the immortals. And they were all the more happy to behold Śrī Hari (Viṣṇu). But when they started looking at Śiva's retinue, every animal they rode started back and fled in panic. The adults recovered themselves and remained where they were, while every child that came ran for its life. On their reaching home when their parents questioned them, they spoke as follows, their limbs still shaking with fear, "What shall we say? The sight was such as could not be described. We wonder whether it was a bridegroom's procession or the army of Death. The bridegroom is a maniac, riding on a bull; serpents, skulls and ashes are his ornaments.

Mainā (Pārvatī's mother) kindled auspicious lights for waving round the bridegroom and the women accompanying her sang melodious songs of rejoicing. A salver of gold adorned Mainā's fair hands and she proceeded to welcome Lord Hara with great delight. The women were seized with excessive fear when they saw Rudra (Śiva) in frightful accoutrements. They fled in great panic and entered the house; while the great Lord Śiva repaired to the lodgings of the bridegroom's party. Mainā was sore distressed at heart and sent for Pārvatī. With great affection she seated her in her lap; and tears rushed to her eyes; which resembled a pair of blue lotuses. "To think that the Creator, who has made you so beautiful, should have been stupid enough to give you such a raving madman for a bridegroom!" (1-4)

In good sooth the sage is passionless and without affection; he has no wealth, no dwelling and no wife and is indifferent to all. That is why he destroys others' homes. He has neither shame nor fear. What does a barren woman know of the pains of childbirth?" Seeing Her mother distressed, Bhavānī addressed the following soft yet prudent words to her. "Whatever is ordained by Providence cannot be altered. Realizing this be not worried, mother. If I am destined to have a crazy husband, why should anyone be blamed for it? Can you alter the decree of Providence? Therefore, take no reproach on you unnecessarily."

He said, "Mainā, hear my true words: your daughter is none else than Bhavānī (the eternal Consort of Śiva), Mother of the universe. She is the unborn and imperishable divine energy, which has no beginning; She is Śambhu's inseparable half. She creates, maintains and then dissolves the universe and assumes the semblance of a material form of Her own will. First she was born in the house of Dakṣa. Sati was Her name and charming was Her form. Even in that incarnation Sati was married with Śaṅkara. The story is well-known throughout the world. One day, while She was returning home with Śiva, She beheld Śrī Rāma, who is a sun as it were to the lotus-like race of Raghu. Bewildered by His sight, She did not listen to Śiva advice and was beguiled into assuming the disguise of Sītā. (1-4)

All the citizens, including men, women and children, youngmen as well as elderly people, were immensely delighted. Festive songs began to be sung in the city; vases of gold of every pattern were displayed by all. Dishes of various kinds were prepared in accordance with the processes given in gastrological works. Is it ever possible to describe the varieties of dishes prepared in the house where lived Mother Bhavānī? Himācala respectfully summoned all the members of the bridegroom's party, including Viṣṇu, Brahmā and other gods of all classes. The dinner guests sat in many rows; and expert cooks began to serve. Finding the gods dining, batches of women began to banter and rail at them in pleasant strains. (1-4)

An altar was prepared in accordance with the Vedic ritual and women chanted charming festal strains. A divinely beautiful throne with the images of a pair of lions for its arms was placed on the altar; being a handiwork of the Creator himself, it beggared description. Bowing His head to the Brāhmaṇas and calling to His mind His own Master, the Lord of Raghus, Śiva took His seat on the throne. The great sages then sent for Umā, who was brought in by Her girl companions richly adorned. All the gods were enraptured at Her beauty. What poet in the world could describe such loveliness? Recognizing in Her the Mother of the universe and Spouse of Śiva, the divinities mentally bowed to Her. The perfection of beauty that Bhavānī was could not be adequately praised even with millions of tongues. (1-4)

When even the Vedas, Śeṣa (the serpent-god) and Śāradā (the goddess of learning) shrink abashed, of what account is the dull-witted Tulasīdāsa? Mother Bhavānī, the mind of beauty, walked to the middle of the pavilion, where Śiva was. Out of shyness She could not gaze on Her lord's lotus feet, although Her heart was fixed thereon like a bee.
