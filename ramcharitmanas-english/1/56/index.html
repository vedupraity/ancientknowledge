The gods made obeisance and rained down flowers; while the sages uttered their benedictions, which were the source of all blessings. The songs that the ladies sang, combined with the sound of kettledrums, produced a loud symphony; men and women both were lost in love and rejoicing. In this manner Sītā entered the pavilion, while great sages recited propitiatory texts in great joy. The two family preceptors (Vasiṣṭha and Śatānanda) performed all the religious rites and ceremonies and observed the family customs. </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Chhands </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> ācāru kari gura gauri ganapati mudita bipra pujāvahīṃ. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> sura pragaṭi pūjā lēhiṃ dēhiṃ asīsa ati sukhu pāvahīṃ.. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> madhuparka maṃgala drabya jō jēhi samaya muni mana mahu cahaiṃ. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> bharē kanaka kōpara kalasa sō saba liēhiṃ paricāraka rahaiṃ..1..

The sun-god himself lovingly pointed out the family usages, which were all scrupulously observed. Having thus caused Sītā to worship the gods, the sages assigned Her a beautiful throne.

Queen Sunayanā shone forth to Janaka's left even as Mainā beside Himavān (the mountain-king). The king and queen joyfully brought and placed with their own hands gold vases and beautiful trays of jewels filled with holy, scented and auspicious water before Śrī Rāma.

The sounds of singing and kettledrums and shouts of victory in the heavens as well as in the city overflowed as it were in all direction . The lotus-feet that ever sparkle in the lake of Śiva's bosom, by thinking of which even for once the mind gets purified and all the impurities of the Kali age are driven away, by whose touch the sage Gautama's wife, who was full of sin, attained salvation, whose nectar in the form of the river Gaṅgā adorns Śambhu's head and is declared by the gods as the holiest of the holy, and by resorting to which with their bee-like minds sages and mystics attain the goal of their liking, it is those very feet that the most lucky Janaka washed amidst shouts of victory from all corners. Joining the palms of the Bride and the Bridegroom, both the family priests recited the genealogy of the two families; and perceiving that the Bridegroom had accepted the Bride's hand, Brahma and the other divinities as well as men and sages were filled with delight. As the king and queen gazed on the Bridegroom, who was the very fountain of joy, the hair on their body stood erect, while their heart was filled with rapture. And having gone through all the rites sanctioned either by the Vedas or by family usage, the glorious King Janaka gave his Daughter to the Bridegroom. As Himavān gave away Girijā to the great Lord Śiva, and the deity presiding over seas bestowed Śrī on Hari, so did Janaka give Sītā to Rāma and thereby earned fair renown of an unprecedented character. King Videha (Janaka) was unable to make any supplication, since that Prince (Śrī Rāma) of swarthy complexion had justified his name (Videha) by making him forget everything about his body. When oblations had been offered to the sacred fire with due rite, the ends of garments of the Bride and the Bridegroom were tied together (as a token of their indissoluble union) and the couple began to circumambulate the fire (in order to show that the two had been united in the presence of the fire-god as a witness). </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> jaya dhuni baṃdī bēda dhuni maṃgala gāna nisāna. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> suni haraṣahiṃ baraṣahiṃ bibudha surataru sumana sujāna..324..

Lovely images of Rāma and Sītā were reflected on the pillars of jewels and shone as if Love and his consort, Rati, witnessed Śrī Rāma's matchless wedding appearing in numerous forms. Their curiosity and bashfulness were equally great; that is why they revealed themselves and went out of sight again and again. All the spectators were enraptured; like Janaka they forgot all about themselves. Joyously the sages bade the Bride and Bridegroom pace round the fire and accomplished all the rites including the ceremonial gifts, Śrī Rāma applied the vermilion to Sītā's forehead, a sight the charm of which was altogether beyond description. It seemed as if with a lotus surcharged with reddish pollen a serpent thirsting for nectar decorated the moon.

There was rejoicing all over the universe; everyone proclaimed that Śrī Rāma's wedding had been accomplished . With one tongue how could anyone describe in full the joy which knew no bounds? Then, receiving Vasiṣṭha's order, Janaka sent for the other three princesses, Māṇḍavī, Śrutakīrti and Urmilā, each clad in a bride's attire. The eldest daughter of his younger brother Kuśaketu, who was an embodiment of goodness, virtue, joy and beauty, he gave in marriage to Bharata after performing every rite with love.

There was much rejoicing both in the heavens and in the city.

Married women, whose husbands were alive, happily brought the brides and bridegrooms to the apartment reserved for the tutelary deities, and with festal songs they most lovingly began to perform customary rites. Goddess Gaurī Herself taught Rāma how to offer a morsel of food to Sītā; while Śāradā urged Sītā to do likewise with Rāma. The whole gynaeceum was absorbed in the delight of merry-making; everyone enjoyed the fruit of her birth. In the gems on Her hand Jānakī saw the reflection of Śrī Rāma, the repository of beauty; hence She dared not move Her arm or eyes for fear of losing sight of Him. The rapture and love that characterized the gaiety and mirth of the occasion surpassed all telling; Sītā's companions alone knew them. They escorted all the four charming couples to the palace assigned to King Daśaratha and his party.

He bestowed upon Sītā a good many men-servants and maid-servants who had been her trusted and favourite attendants. As She proceeded on Her journey the citizens felt miserable; while good omens, which were all fountains of blessings, appeared. Accompanied by a crowd of Brāhmaṇas and his counsellors the king himself followed his daughters to escort them. When it was found that the time of departure had come, music began to play and the members of the bridegrooms' party made ready their chariots, elephants and horses. King Daśaratha summoned all the Brāhmaṇas and sated them with gifts and courtesy. The king placed the dust of their lotus-feet on his head and was glad to receive their benediction. Invoking the elephant-headed Gaṇeśa he set out on his journey, when many good omens, which were the roots of felicity, occurred. </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> sura prasūna baraṣahi haraṣi karahiṃ apacharā gāna. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> calē avadhapati avadhapura mudita bajāi nisāna..339..

The Lord of Ayodhyā importuned King Janaka over and over again; but out of affection for his relative the latter would not turn back. Once more King Daśaratha addressed him in polite terms, "I beg you to turn back, O king; you have already advanced too far." At last King Daśaratha got down from his chariot and remained standing, while his eyes overflowed with torrents of love.

The joy and the bright renown which the regional lords of the universe long to have, but feel too diffident to expect-such a joy and glory has been brought within my reach; and all achievements follow on seeing you." In these words King Janaka made humble submission to Viśvāmitra, bowing his head again and again, and returned after receiving his blessings. The bridegrooms' party started on its return journey to the sound of kettledrums; all the sections, both big and small, were transported with joy.
