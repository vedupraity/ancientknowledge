The piety and conduct of the pair were excellent; the standard of morality set up by them is sung by the Vedas even to this day. Their son was king Uttanapada, who begot the celebrated devotee of Sri Hari, Dhruva. Manu's younger son was known as Priyavrata, who is mentioned with praise by the Vedas and the Puranas. They had a daughter too, Devahuti by name, who was the favourite consort of the sage Kardama, and who bore in her womb the all-powerful and benevolent Lord Kapila the primal divinity, who is compassionate to the humble and who openly expounded the philosophy of Sankhya, an adept as He was in the enquiry after the ultimate principles. The said Manu ruled for a long period and followed the Lord's commandments (in the form of the scriptural ordinance) in everyway.

Pre-eminent of all holy places is the celebrated Naimisaranya (the modern Nimsar in Oudh), which is most sacred and bestows success on those striving for realization. Multitudes of sages and adepts lived there. Glad of heart, king Manu proceeded to that place. Passing along the road, the king and queen of resolute mind looked like incarnations of spiritual wisdom and devotion respectively. On reaching the bank of the Gomati they bathed with delight in the limpid stream. Adepts and enlightened sages came to see him, recognizing in the royal sage a champion of virtue. The sages reverently took them to all holy and lovely spots that were scattered here and there. With emaciated bodies and clad in hermits' robes they daily listened to the Puranas in the assembly of saints.

Again, they started undergoing penance for the sake of Sri Hari, giving up roots and fruits for water alone, Their heart ever clamoured, "Let us see with our eyes that supreme Lord who is without attributes, without parts and without beginning or end, who is contemplated upon by the exponents of the highest reality, whom the Vedas describe in negative terms such as 'Not this, not this', who is bliss itself, unconditioned and without comparison, and from a particle of whose being emanate a number of Sambhus, Virancis and Visnus." Even such a Lord is subordinate to the will of His devotees and assumes for their sake a form suitable for sport. If the above utterance of the Vedas is true, our desire will be surely accomplished.

                                                            For ten thousand years they refused to inhale even air (i.e., held their breath) and remained standing on one leg. Beholding their great penance Brahma, Hari and Hara repeatedly called on Manu and tempted him in many ways, saying "Ask for a boon." But the king and queen were most resolute and did not swerve in spite of the deities' efforts to deflect them from their course. Although their frame had been reduced to a mere skeleton there was not the least anguish in their heart. The omniscient Lord now recognized the king and queen as His own servants. The ascetic couple solely depended on Him. In the meantime a most deep voice thundered from heaven, "Ask, ask for a boon." The voice was steeped in the nectar of compassion and was so charming that it infused life into the dead. Entering through the cavity of the ears when it reached their very heart, they found their body attractive, animated and robust as before, as if they had just returned from home.

The dust below Your feet is adored by Brahma, Hari and Hara. You are easy to serve and a fountain of all blessings. You are the protector of the suppliant and the lord of all creation, both animate and inanimate. O friend of the forlorn, if You have any affection for us, be pleased to grant this boon to us. The form which dwells in Siva heart and is sought by sages, which sports like a swan in the lake of Bhusundi's mind and is glorified by the Vedas as both with and without attributes-be gracious to us and let us feast our eyes on that form; O Reliever of the distress of the suppliant." The soft and humble words of the royal couple, steeped as they were in the nectar of love, were liked by the Lord very much. Full of affection for His devotees and a storehouse of compassion, the all-powerful Lord, who pervades the whole universe, manifested Himself.

Lovely were His cheeks and chin and His neck resembled the conch-shell in its spiral shape. His ruddy lips, teeth and nose were charming. His smile put to shame the rays of the moon. His eyes possessed the exquisite beauty of fresh-blown lotuses and His lovely glance captivated the heart. His eyebrows stole the beauty of Love's bow and a sectarian mark shone on His forehead. Fish-shaped ear-rings hung from his earlobes and a crown adorned His head. His curly locks looked like a swarm of bees. His breast was marked by a curl of hair and adorned with a beautiful wreath of sylvan flowers, a string of precious stones and other jewelled ornaments. His strong and wellbuilt neck resembled that of a lion and the lovely sacred thread was suspended from it. His long beautiful arms resembled the trunk of an elephant. The ornaments adorning them were also charming. A quiver was tied to His waist and His hands bore an arrow and a bow

On His left side shone His primordial energy, Sita, who is ever devoted to Him, and who is a storehouse of beauty and the source of the universe. Sita, who stood to the left of Sri Rama, was the same from a fragment of whose being emanate countless Laksmi, Umas and Brahmanis (Sarasvatis), all mines of virtues, and the mere play of whose eyebrows brings the cosmos into existence. On the form of Sri Hari, the ocean of beauty, Manu and Satarupa gazed intently with unblinking eyes. That incomparable beauty they looked on with reverence and would not feel sated with it. Overcome with joy they lost consciousness of their body and fell flat on the ground, clasping His feet with their hands. The gracious Lord touched their heads with His own lotus hands and lifted them up at once.

Yet one ardent longing still lingers in my heart. It is easy of accomplishment and at the same time hard to attain; hence it cannot be expressed. O Lord, it is easy for You to grant it; but due to my wretched condition it appears to me so hard to attain. Just as a pauper who has found a wish-yielding tree feels shy in asking for abundant wealth, little realizing its glory, even so my heart is possessed by doubt. Being the witness of all hearts, You know my mind; therefore, O my master, grant my desire." "O king, ask of Me unreservedly; there is nothing which I would not give you."

You are the progenitor even of Brahma and other gods, the lord of the universe and the Supreme Being who dwells within the heart of all. Realizing this, my mind is filled with doubt; but what You have said is infallible. O my master, the bliss that is enjoyed and the goal that is reached by your own devotees-

Mother, by My grace your uncommon wisdom shall never fail." Bowing at His feet, Manu again said, "Lord, I have once more request to make. Let me have attachment to Your feet, of the same type as one has for a son, no matter if anyone calls me a big fool. Just as a snake cannot live without the gem on its hood and a fish without water, even so let my life be dependent on You (let me not survive without You)." Asking this boon, the king remained clasping the Lord's feet till the All-merciful said, "Let it be so. Now, obeying My command go and dwell in the capital of Indra (the chief of gods)."

Bodying Myself forth with My rays I will perform sportive acts which will be a source of delight to My devotees. Hearing of such exploits with reverence blessed men shall cross the ocean of worldly existence, renouncing the feeling of meum and arrogance. This Maya, who is no other than My primordial energy that has brought forth the universe, She too will manifest Herself. In this way I will accomplish your desire and this pledge of Mine shall never, never, never fail." Repeating this again and again, the gracious Lord vanished out of sight. Cherishing in their mind the image of the Lord who is so compassionate to His devotees, the wedded couple stayed in that hermitage for some time more. And dropping their body, when the time came, without the least pain they went and took their abode in Amaravati, the city of immortals.
