After due homage, reverence and courtesy the deputation conducted the bridegroom's party to the lodgings set apart for them. Gorgeous cloths were spread as carpets for the royal guests to tread upon, on seeing which Kubera (the god of wealth) was no longer proud of his wealth. Magnificent were the quarters assigned to the bridegroom's party, which provided every kind of comfort for each guest.

When the two brothers heard of their father's arrival, they could not contain themselves for joy, but were too modest to speak to their Guru, though their heart longed to see their sire. Viśvāmitra felt much gratified at heart to perceive this great humility. In his joy he pressed the two brothers to his bosom; a thrill ran through his limbs, while tears rushed to his eyes.

Pressing the boys to his bosom he allayed the unbearable pangs of separation and looked like a dead body restored to life. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa then bowed their head at Vasistha's feet and the great sage embraced them in the ecstasy of love. The two brothers next saluted all the Brāhmaṇas and in turn received their welcome blessings. Bharata and his younger half-brother (Śatrughna) greeted Rāma, who lifted them and embraced them.

Daśaratha shone in all his glory with his followers; his magnificence put to shame the guardians of the different worlds.

There was such a great uproar in the heavens as well as in the city that no one could hear one's own words, much less of others.

The two monarchs while embracing each other presented a glorious spectacle; poets made repeated efforts to find a suitable analogy but felt abashed at their failure. Finding no comparison anywhere, they felt baffled and concluded that the pair could be likened to themselves alone. The gods were enraptured to see the tie of love between the two kings united by marriage alliance; raining down flowers they began to sing the glories of both. "Ever since Brahma created the world, we have witnessed and heard of many a marriage; but it is only today that we have seen the pomp and grandeur on both sides so well-balanced in every respect and the fathers of the bride and the bridegroom so well-matched." Hearing the above voice from heaven, which was so charming yet so true, there was a flood of transcendent love on both sides.
