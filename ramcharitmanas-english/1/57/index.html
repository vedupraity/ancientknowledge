Similarly there was a clash of cymbals and drums, while clarionets played sweet tunes. The citizens were all delighted to hear the procession coming; the hair on their body stood erect. They all decorated their own beautiful houses as well as the markets, streets, squares and gates of the city. All the lanes were watered with perfumes; here and there festal squares were filled in with elegant devices. The bazar was beautified beyond all description with festal arches, flags, banners and canopies. Trees of the areca-nut, the plantain, the mango, the Bakula, the Kadamba and the Tamala were transplanted alongwith their fruit. The beautiful trees thus planted touched the ground (on account of their being laden with fruits); they had basins of precious stones constructed around them with exquisite skill.

It looked as if auspicious omens and loveliness; affluence and mystic powers, joys and smiling prosperity and all kinds of rejoicings had assumed a naturally beautiful form and taken their abode in the palace of King Daśaratha. Tell me who would not feel tempted to have a look at Śrī Rāma and Videha's Daughter? Married women, whose husbands were alive, sallied forth in troops, each eclipsing Love's consort (Rati) by her beauty. They all carried articles of good omen and were equipped with lights for waving round the bridegrooms. As they moved along singing all the way, it appeared as if Goddess Bharati (the goddess of speech) had appeared in so many forms. The king's palace was full of hilarious tumult; the joy of the occasion was ineffable. Kausalya and other mothers of Śrī Rāma were so overwhelmed with emotion that they forgot their own body.

Full of intense longing for a sight of Śrī Rāma they began to get everything ready for the reception of their sons. Music of every kind started playing, while Sumitrā gladly got together articles of good omen such as turmeric, blades of Durva grass, curds, ordinary leaves, flowers, betel-leaves, arecanuts, auspicious roots, unbroken rice, sprouts of barley, Gorocana, parched paddy and lovely blossoms of the Basil plant. Exceedingly charming gold vases, painted with various colours, looked like nests built by Cupid's own birds. Auspicious perfumes defied all description. In this way all the queens prepared all sorts of auspicious articles. They got ready rows of lights arranged in various devices for waving round their sons and with a cheerful heart sang melodious festal strains.

The gods rained down wreaths of flowers from the trees of paradise, which looked like rows of herons in their graceful flight. Lovely festoons made of Jewels looked like rainbows appearing in a row. Charming ladies, appearing on house-tops as quickly as they went out of sight, looked like the fitful flashes of lightning. The beat of drums resembled the crash of thunder; while beggars were as clamorous as the Cātaka birds, frogs and peacocks. The gods poured down showers in the form of sacred perfumes, which gladdened the crop in the form of all the citizens. Perceiving that a propitious hour had arrived the preceptor (Vasistha) gave the word, and the jewel of Raghu's race, King Daśaratha, gladly entered the city with all his followers, fixing his mind on Bhagavān Śambhu, Goddess Pārvatī and Their son, Lord Gaṇeśa.

Auspicious shouts of victory and the sacred and melodious chanting of the Vedas were heard in all the ten directions. Musical instruments of all kinds began to play; gods in heaven and men in the city were enraptured alike. Members of the bridegroom's party looked smart beyond description. They were highly delighted and could not contain themselves for joy. The people of Ayodhyā then greeted the king, and were gladdened at the very sight of Śrī Rāma. They scattered about Him jewels and vestments; their eyes were full of tears and their body thrilled over. The women of the city gladly waved lights around His head and rejoiced to see the four noble princes. They were all the more gratified when they lifted the curtains of the beautiful palanquins and beheld the brides.

                                                            There were four exquisitely beautiful thrones, which had been fashioned by Cupid with his own hands as it were; the queen-mothers seated the brides and the bridegrooms on them and reverently laved their holy feet. They then worshipped the blessed couples in accordance with the Vedic ritual by offering them incense, light and oblations of food. They passed lights around them again and again and waved beautiful fans and chowries over their heads. They scattered offerings of various kinds about them; the mothers were as full of exultation as a Yogi who has realized the highest truth, or as a lifelong patient who has been able to lay his hands on nectar or as a born pauper who has stumbled on a philosopher's stone, or as a blind man who has regained a good vision, or as a dumb fellow, whose tongue has been transfused with the eloquence of Śāradā, the goddess of speech, or even as a hero who has triumphed in battle.

As the mothers performed the traditional rites the brides and their grooms felt shy; while Śrī Rāma smiled within Himself on perceiving the ecstasy and merriment of the occasion.

Bowing to all they begged as a boon the welfare of Rāma and His brothers. The gods conferred their blessings all unseen, and the mothers gladly received them by spreading the end of their garment (as a token of respect). The king sent for those who had joined the marriage party and gave them vehicles, wearing apparel, jewels and ornaments. Having received the king's permission and enshrining Śrī Rāma's image in their heart they joyfully returned each to his own house. All the men and women of the city were invested with garments and jewels and there was jubilant music in every home. The king in his exultation gave whatever the mendicants asked for. Every attendant and every musician was sated with gifts and kind attentions.

The queens, on seeing a crowd of Brāhmaṇas, deemed themselves most fortunate and all rose to greet them. They laved the feet of the holy ones and helped them all perform their ablutions; while the king duly worshipped and entertained them at meal. Overwhelmed with the host's civility, gifts and love, they departed glad of heart invoking blessings on him. To Gadhi's son (Viśvāmitra) he paid homage in various ways and said, "My lord, there is no one so blessed as I am." The king lavished his praises on him and took the dust of his feet with his queens. He assigned the sage a fine quarter in his own palace, while the king and his whole gynaeceum kept a vigilant eye on his wants even though unexpressed. Again he adored the lotus feet of his preceptor (Vasistha) and made humble submission to him with great affection in his heart.

He gladly took the boys in his arms and experienced a thrill of joy which nobody could tell. Similarly he affectionately seated the brides in his lap and fondled them again and again with a heart full of rapture. The ladies of the gynaeceum were delighted to behold this spectacle; the heart of everyone became an abode of joy. The king related how the wedding had taken place and everyone was delighted to hear the account. The goodness, amiability, nobility, loving nature and the splendid wealth of King Janaka were extolled by King Daśaratha in a variety of ways even as a rhapsodist would do; and the queens were enraptured to hear the record of his doings.

After rinsing their mouth the king and his party were all given betel-leaves; and adorned with garlands and sandal-paste etc., they looked most charming. Looking once more at Śrī Rāma and having received His permission they proceeded each to his own house, bowing their heads to Him. The love and rapture, meriment and magnanimity, prosperity, splendour and loveliness that manifested there were more than could be told by a hundred Saradas and Sesas, Vedas and Brahmas, Sivas and Ganesas. How, then, can I describe them at length any more than an earthly serpent could support the globe on its head? The king then summoned the queens and, showing every honour to them all, admonished them in gentle tones. "The brides are yet damsels and have come to a strange house; therefore, take care of them as eyelids protect the eyes.

Even while you and your brother (lakṣmaṇa) guarded the sacrifice, you were initiated into all the secret lore. At the mere touch of the dust from your feet the hermit's wife (Ahalyā) attained salvation and your glory filled the whole universe. In the assembly of princes you broke Śiva bow, hard though it was as a tortoise-shell or adamant or rock. You gained the glory of having triumphed over the world and won the hand of Janaka's daughter, and then returned home after marrying all your brothers. All your actions have been superhuman and were accomplished only by the grace of the sage Kausika. Our birth into the world has borne fruit today as we now behold, dear child, your moon-like face. Our prayer is that the number of days that have been spent without seeing you, may not be reckoned by the Creator at all."

In every house women kept vigil and railed at one another in auspicious strains. The queens said to one another, "See, friends, how resplendent the city is, and how splendid the night!" The mothers-in-law then slept with the lovely brides enfolded in their arms even as serpents would clasp to their bosom the gems from their hood. At the holy hour before dawn the Lord awoke, and the cocks commenced their beautiful crowing. The rhapsodists and genealogists sang His praises, while the citizens flocked to the gate to make their obeisance. The four brothers saluted the Brāhmaṇas and gods as well as their preceptor and parents and were glad to receive their benedictions. The mothers reverently gazed on their countenance as the princes repaired to the gate with the king.

The whole court was gratified to see Rāma and accounted their eyes supremely blest. Then came the sages Vasistha and Viśvāmitra and were seated on splendid seats. The father and sons adored the sages and clasped their feet and the two preceptors were enraptured to behold Śrī Rāma. The sage Vasistha narrated sacred legends, while the king and the ladies of the gynaeceum listened. In the course of his narration the sage gladly recounted in diverse ways the doings of Viśvāmitra, that surpassed the imagination even of hermits. Vamadeva (another family preceptor of King Daśaratha) observed that whatever Vasistha said was true and that Viśvāmitra's fair renown had pervaded all the three spheres. Everyone rejoiced to hear that, while Śrī Rāma and lakṣmaṇa were all the more delighted at heart.

The gods were filled with envy to see new rejoicings everyday and begged of the Creator that they might be born in Ayodhyā. Viśvāmitra intended leaving everyday, but was detained by Śrī Rāma's affectionate entreaties. Seeing the king's devotion to him grow a hundredfold day after day the great sage Viśvāmitra was full of praise for him. At last when he asked permission to go, the king was greatly moved and with his sons stood before him saying, "My lord, all that I have is yours; while I and my sons and wives are your servants. Be ever gracious to these boys and condescend from time to time to bless me with your sight." So saying, the king with his sons and queens fell at his feet, and speech failed his tongue. The Brahmana (Viśvāmitra) invoked upon him every kind of blessing and departed amidst a scene of love that defied all description. Śrī Rāma and all His brothers lovingly escorted him and returned only when they were allowed to go back.
