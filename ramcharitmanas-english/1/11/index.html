                                                            I greet the name 'Rama' of the chief of Raghus,<em> which is composed of seed-letters</em> representing the fire-god, the sun-god and the moon-god (viz., Ra, a and Ma respectively). It is the same as Brahma (the creative aspect of God), Visnu (His preservative aspect) and Siva (His disintegrating aspect), and the vital breath of the Vedas; It is attributeless, peerless and a mine of virtues. It is the great spell which Lord Mahesvara mutters and which, when imparted by Him at Kasi (the modern Varanasi) leads to emancipation†. Its glory is known to Lord Ganesa, who is worshipped before all others as a concession to the Name‡. The oldest poet (Valmiki) is acquainted with the glory of the Name, inasmuch as he attained to purity by repeating It in the reverse order§. Hearing the verdict of Lord Siva that the name is as good as a thousand other names of God, Goddess Bhavani (Parvati) dined with Her consort after uttering It only once#. Noticing such partiality of Her heart for the Name, Hara (Lord Siva) made that lady, who was the ornament of Her sex, the ornament of His own person (i.e., made Her a part of His own being by assigning to Her the left half of His body). Siva knows full well the power of the Name, due to which deadly poison served the purpose of nectar to Him.(1-4)

                                                            Both the letter-sounds are sweet and attractive; they are the two eyes, as it were, of the Alphabet and the very life of the devotee. Easy to remember and delightful to one and all, they bring gain here and provide sustenance hereafter. They are most delightful to utter, hear and remember and are dear as Rama and Laksmana to Tulasidasa. When treated separately, the two letters lose their harmony (i.e., are differently pronounced, bear diverse meaning in the form of seed-letters and as such yield different results); whereas they are naturally allied even as Brahma (the Cosmic Spirit) and Jiva (the individual soul) Good brothers like the divine sages Nara and Narayana, they are sustainers of the universe and redeemers of the devotee in particular. They are beautiful ornaments for the ears of the fair damsel in the form of Bhakti (Devotion) and stand as the spotless sun and moon for the good of the world.They are like the taste and the gratifying quality of nectar in the form of emancipation, and are supporters of the globe like the divine Tortoise* and the serpent-god Sesa. Again, they are like bees for the beautiful lotus in the shape of the devotee's mind and are the very like of Hari (Sri Krsna) and Haladhara (Balarama, who wielded a plough as a weapon) for Yasoda (Their foster- mother, the wife of Nanda) in the shape of the tongue.(1-4)

                                                            The name and the object named, though similar in significance, are allied as master and servant one to the other. (That is to say, even though there is complete identity between God and His name, the former closely follows the latter even as a servant follows his master. The Lord appears in person at the very mention of His Name). Name and form are the two attributes of God; both of them are ineffable and beginningless and can be rightly understood only by means of good intelligence. It is presumptuous on one's part to declare as to which is superior or inferior. Hearing the distinctive merits of both, pious souls will judge for themselves. Forms are found to be subordinate to the name; without the name you cannot come to the knowledge of a form. Typical forms cannot be identified, even if they be in your hand, without knowing their name. And if the name is remembered even without seeing the form, the latter flashes on the mind with a special liking for it. The mystery of name and form is a tale which cannot be told; though delightful to comprehend, it cannot be described in words. Between the unqualified Absolute and qualified Divinity, the Name is a good intermediary; it is a clever interpreter revealing the truth of both.(1-4)

                                                            Yogis (mystics) who are full of dispassion and are wholly detached from God's creation keep awake (in the daylight of wisdom) muttering the Name with their tongue, and enjoy the felicity of Brahma (the Absolute), which is incomparable, unspeakable, unmixed with sorrow and devoid of name and form. Even those (seekers of Truth) who aspire to know the mysterious ways of Providence are able to comprehend them by muttering the Name. Strivers (hankering after worldly achievements) repeat the Name, absorbed in contemplation, and become accomplished, acquiring superhuman powers such as that of becoming infinitely small in size.* If devotees in distress mutter the Name, their worst calamities of the gravest type disappear and they become happy. In this world there are four kinds of devotees† of Sri Rama; all the four of them are virtuous, sinless and noble. All the four, clever as they are, rely upon the Name. Of these the enlightened devotee is specially dear to the Lord. The glory of the Name is supreme in all the four Yugas and all the four Vedas, particularly in the Kali age, in which there is no other means of salvation.(1-4)

                                                            There are two aspects of God-the one unqualified and the other qualified. Both these aspects are unspeakable, unfathomable, without beginning and without parallel. To my mind, greater than both is the Name, that has established Its rule over both by Its might. Friends should not take this as a bold assertion on the part of this servant; I record my mind's own conviction, partiality and liking. The two aspects of Brahma (God) should be recognized as akin to fire: the one (viz., the Absolute) represents fire which is latent in wood; while the other (qualified Divinity) corresponds to that which is externally visible. Though both are inaccessible by themselves, they are easily attainable through the Name; therefore I have called the Name greater than Brahma and Sri Rama both. Brahma (God) is one, all-pervading and imperishable; He is all truth, consciousness and a compact mass of joy. Even though such immutable Lord is present in every heart, all beings in this world are nonetheless miserable and unhappy. Through the practice of the Name preceded by Its true appraisement, however, the same Brahma reveals Itself even as the value of a jewel is revealed by its correct knowledge.(1-4)

                                                            For the sake of His devotees Sri Rama assumed the form of a human being and, suffering calamities Himself, brought relief to the pious. By fondly repeating His Name, on the other hand, devotees easily become abodes of joy and blessings. Sri Rama Himself redeemed a single woman (Ahalya),1 the wife of an ascetic; while His Name corrected the error of crores of wicked souls. For the sake of the sage (Visvamitra) Sri Rama wrought the destruction of Suketu's daughter2 (Tadaka) with her army and son (Subahu); while His Name puts an end to the devotee's vain hopes alongwith his errors and sorrows even as the sun terminates night. In His own person Sri Rama broke the bow of Siva3, while the very glory of His Name dispels the fear of rebirth4. The Lord restored the charm of the Dandaka forest5 alone, while His Name purified the mind of countless devotees .The Delighter of Raghus (Sri Rama) crushed only a host of demons, while His Name uproots all the impurities of the Kali age.(1-4)

                                                            As is well-known to all, Sri Rama extended His protection to two devotees only, viz., Sugriva and Vibhisana; His Name, on the other hand, has showered Its grace on numerous humble souls. This superb glory of the Name shines forth in the world as well as in the Vedas. Sri Rama collected an army of bears and monkeys and took no little pains over the construction of a bridge (to connect the mainland with the island of Lanka). Through the repetition of His Name, however, the ocean of mundane existence itself gets dried up: let the wise bear this in mind. Sri Rama killed in battle Ravana with all his family and returned to His own city with Sita. He was then crowned king in the capital of Ayodhya, while gods and sages sung His glories in choicest phrases. His servants are, however, able to conquer the formidable army of error by fondly remembering His Name and, absorbed in devotion, move about in joy which is peculiarly their own; by the grace of the Name they know not sorrow even in dream.(1-4)

Knowing this in His heart, the great Lord Siva chose this word (Rama) for Himself out of Sri Rama's story comprising 100 crore verses.*(25)

                                                            By the grace of the Name alone Lord Sambhu (Siva) is immortal and, though endowed with inauspicious paraphernalia (such as a wreath of skulls), is yet a storehouse of blessings. Again, it is by the grace of the Name alone that Siddhas (adepts), sages and Yogis like Suka, Sanaka and others enjoy divine raptures, Narada realized the glory of the Name; that is why, while Sri Hari is beloved of the world (and Hara is dear to Sri Hari), he (Narada) is dear to Hari and Hara (Visnu and Siva) both. It was because of his repeating the Name that the Lord showered His grace on Prahlada, who thereby became the crest-jewel of devotees. Dhruva repeated the name of Sri Hari with a feeling of indignation (at the harsh treatment received from his step-mother) and thereby attained a fixed and incomparable station in the heavens. It is by remembering the holy Name that Hanuman (son of the wind-god) holds Sri Rama under His thumb. The vile Ajamila and even the celebrated elephant and the harlot of the legend were liberated by the power of Sri Hari's name.

                                                            (Not only in this Kali age, but) in all the four ages*, at all times (past, present and future) and in all the three spheres (viz., heaven, earth and the subterranean region) creatures have been rid of grief by repeating the Name. The verdict of the Vedas and the Puranas as well as of saints is just this; that love of Rama (or the name 'Rama') is the reward of all virtuous acts. In the first age, contemplation; in the second age, sacrifice; in the Dvapara age the Lord is propitiated through worship. This age of Kali, however, is simply corrupt and the root of all impurities, where the mind of man wallows like a fish in the ocean of sin. In this terrible age the Name alone is the wish-yielding tree, the very thought of which puts an end to all the illusions of the world. The Name of Rama is the bestower of one's desired object in this age of Kali; It is beneficent in the other world and one's father and mother in this world. In Kaliyuga neither Karma (action) nor Bhakti (devotion) nor again Jnana (knowledge) avails; the name of Rama is the only resort. The age of Kali is as it were the demon Kalanemi, the repository of all wiles; whereas the Name is the wise and mighty Hanuman.†(1-4)

                                                            The Name repeated either with good or evil intentions, in an angry mood or even while yawning, diffuses joy in all the ten directions. Remembering that Name and bowing my head to the Lord of Raghus, I proceed to recount the virtues of Sri Rama. He whose grace is never tired of showing its good-will to others will mend my errors in everyway. Rama a noble Lord, and a poor servant like myself! Yet, true to His own disposition, that storehouse of compassion has fostered me. In the world as well as in the Vedas we observe the following characteristic in a good master, viz., that he comes to recognize one's devotion to him as soon as he hears one's prayer. Rich or poor, rustic or urban, learned or unlettered, of good repute or bad, a good poet or a bad one, all men and women extol the king according to his or her light. And the pious, sensible, amiable and supremely compassionate ruler, who takes his descent from a ray of God, greets all with sweet words hearing their compliments and appraising their composition, devotion, supplication and conduct. Such is the way of earthly monarchs, to say nothing of the Lord of Kosala (Sri Rama), who is the crest-jewel of wise men. Sri Rama gets pleased with unalloyed love; but who is duller and more impure of mind in this world than I ?(1-6)
