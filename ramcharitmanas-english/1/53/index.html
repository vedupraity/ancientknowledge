                                                            Said Laksmana with a smile, "Listen, holy Sir: to my mind all bows are alike. What gain or loss can there be in the breaking of a worn-out bow ?" Sri Rama mistook it for a new one, and at His very touch it broke in two; the Lord of Raghus, therefore, was not to blame for it either. Why, then, be angry, reverend sir, for no cause?" Casting a glance at his axe, Parasurama replied, "O foolish child, have you never heard of my temper ? I slay you not because, as I say, you are a child yet; do you take me for a mere anchorite, O dullard? I have been a celibate from my very boyhood, but also an irascible one; and I am known throughout the world as a sworn enemy of the Ksatriya race. By the might of my arm I made the earth kingless and bestowed it time after time upon the Brahmanas. Look at this axe, which lopped off the arms of Sahasrabahu (the thousandarmed Kartavirya), O youthful prince.

He flaunts his axe before me again and again, as if he would blow away a mountain with a mere puff of breath. Here there is no pumpkin in the bud that would wither away as soon as an index finger is raised against it. It was only when I saw you armed with an axe and a bow and arrows that I spoke with some pride. Now that I understand you are a descendant of Bhrgu and perceive a sacred thread on your person, I suppress my anger and put up with whatever you say. In our family valour is never shown against gods, the Brahmanas, devotees of Sri Hari and the cow; for by killing any of these we incur sin while a defeat at their hands will bring disrepute on us. We should throw ourselves at your feet even if you strike us. Every word of yours is as incisive as millions of thunderbolts; the bow and arrows and the axe are, therefore, an unnecessary burden to you.

A dark spot on the moon-like solar race, he is utterly unruly, senseless and reckless. The very next moment he shall find himself in the jaws of death; I proclaim it at the top of my voice and none should blame me for it. Forbid him if you would save him, telling him of my glory, might and fury." Said Laksmana, "Holy sir, so long as you live who else can expatiate on your bright glory ? With your own lips you have recounted your exploits in diverse ways more than once. If you are not yet satisfied, tell us something more; do not undergo a severe trial by putting any restraint upon your anger. You have assumed the role of a hero and are resolute and imperturbable; it is unbecoming of you to pour abuses.

Hearing Laksmana's harsh words Parasurama closed his hand upon his terrible axe. "After this let no one blame me; this sharp-tongued boy deserves his death. I have spared him long on account of his being a child; he is now surely going to die." Said Visvamitra, "Pardon his offence; holy men take no notice of the merits and demerits of a child." "Sharp-edged is my axe, while I am pitiless and furious; and here stands before me an offender and an enemy of my Guru. Even though he gives a retort, I spare his life solely out of regard for you, O Visvamitra. Or else, hacking him to pieces with this cruel axe, I would have easily repaid the debt I have owed to my Guru."

You have fully paid the debt you owed to your parents;† the only debt which now remains to be paid by you is the one you owe to your Guru, and that has been vexing your mind not a little. It looks as if you had incurred the debt on our account; and since a considerable time has now elapsed a heavy interest has accumulated thereon. Now you get the creditor here and I will at once rapay him from my own purse." Hearing these sarcastic remarks Parasurama grasped his axe and the whole assembly cried "Alack ! Alack !!" " O chief of Bhrgus, you are still threatening me with your axe; but I am sparing you only because I hold you to be a Brahmana, O enemy of princes. You have never met champions staunch in fight; You have grown important in your own little home, O holy Brahmana." Everyone exclaimed, "This is wholly undesirable!" The Lord of Raghus now becked Laksmana to stop.

If he had any idea of your might, how could he be so foolish as to affront you? If children play some pranks, their teacher and parents are in raptures at it; therefore, take pity on him, knowing him to be a child and your servant. For you are an even-minded, good-tempered, forbearing and illumined anchorite." On hearing Sri Rama's words Parasurama cooled down a little; but uttering something Laksmana smiled again. Seeing him smile, Parasurama flushed all over with sage and said," Rama, your brother is too wicked. Though fair of hue, he is black at heart; he has deadly poison, and not the mother's milk on his lips. Perverse by nature, he does not take after you, nor does this vile imp regard me as the very image of Death."

Pray sit down; your legs must be aching. If you are very fond of it, let us devise some means to mend it by calling in some expert." Janaka was frightened at Laksmana's words and said, "Pray be quiet; it is not good to transgress the limits of propriety." The people of the city trembled like aspen leaves; they said to themselves." The younger prince is really very naughty." As the chief of Bhrgus heard the fearless words of Laksmana, his whole body burnt with rage and his strength diminished. In a condescending manner he said to Rama,"I am sparing the boy because I know he is your younger brother. So fair without and foul within, he resembles a jar of gold full of poison."

A wasp and a child have alike disposition; saints never find fault with them. Besides, the boy has done you no harm; it is I, my lord, who have offended you. Therefore, your reverence, deal to me as your servant whatever you please, whether it be a favour or frown, death or captivity. Tell me quickly the means, O chief of sages, by which your anger may be appeased; I shall do accordingly." Said the sage, "How can my passion be pacified, O Rama, when your younger brother is still looking mischievously at me. So long as I do not cut his throat with my axe, my wrath is ineffectual."

Fate has turned against me; that is why I find my nature changed. Otherwise compassion at any time is unknown to my heart. My tenderness of feeling has imposed on me a severe strain today." On hearing this the son of Sumitra bowed his head with a smile. "The breeze of your benevolence is so befitting your frame; the words you speak appear as though blossoms drop from a tree. O reverend sir, when compassion sets your whole frame on fire, God help you when you are angry." "Look here, Janaka, this stupid boy in his perversity intends to migrate to the region of Death. Why not put him out of my sight ? Though small to look at, the princeling is yet so wicked !" Laksmana smilingly said to himself, "Shut your eyes and the whole world will vanish out of your sight."

                                                            It is with your connivance that your brother addresses such pungent words to me; while you make false entreaties with joined palms. Either give me satisfaction in combat, or forswear your name of 'Rama'. Give battle to me. O enemy of Siva, without taking recourse to any wily trick; or else I will despatch you and your brother both." While the chief of Bhrgus thus raved with his axe raised on high, Sri Rama smiled within Himself, bowing His head to the sage, "While the fault is Laksmana's, the sage's wrath is against me. Sometimes meekness too begets much evil. A crooked man is reverenced by all; the crescent moon is not devoured by the demon Rahu." Said Rama, "Cease from wrath, O lord of sages; the axe is in your hand, while my head is before you. Do that, my lord, which may pacify your anger; know me to be your servant."

Although he knew you by name, he did not recognize you in person and answered you according to his lineage. If you had come as a sage, the child, O holy sir, would have placed the dust of your feet on his head. Forgive the error of one who did not know you; a Brahmana should have plenty of mercy in his heart. What comparison, my lord, can there be between you and me? Tell me if there is any affinity between the head and feet. Mine is a small name consisting of the single word 'Rama'; where as yours is a long one, having the word 'Parasu' prefined to 'Rama'. O lord, whereas there is only one merit in me and that is my bow while you have got nine most auspicious characteristics such as; tranquillity, restraint, penance, purity, forbearance, straight forwardness, knowledge, supreme knowledge and faith in God. I am thus inferior to you in everyway; therefore, O holy sir, forgive my faults."

Know that the bow is my sacrificial ladle, the arrows my oblation and my wrath, the blazing fire; the brilliant fourfold forces (consisting of the horse, the elephant, the chariots and footsoldiers) are the fuel; and mighty princes have served as victims, whom I have cut to pieces with this very axe and offered as sacrifice. In this way I have performed millions of sacrifices in the shape of armed conflicts, accompanied by the muttering of sacred formulas in the shape of war-cries. My glory is not known to you; that is why you address me in contemptuous terms mistaking me for a mere Brahmana. Since you have broken the bow, your arrogance has transgressed all limits; in your self-esteem you stand as if you have conquered the whole world." Said Rama, "O sage, think before you speak; your anger is out of all proportions with my error, which is a trifling one. Worn out as it was, the bow broke at my mere touch. What reason have I to be proud?"

                                                            A god, a demon, a king or a body of warriors, whether My equal in strength or more powerful than myself-should any of these challenge me to combat, I would gladly fight with him, no matter if it is Death himself. For he who is born as a Ksatriya, and is yet afraid of fighting, is a veritable wretch and has brought a slur on his lineage. I tell you in my natural way and not by way of a tribute to my race: Raghu's descendants do not tremble to meet in fight even Death. Such is the glory of the Brahmana race that he who is afraid of you (Brahmanas) is rid of all fear." When he heard these soft yet profound words of Sri Rama, Parasurama's mind was disillusioned. "O Rama, take this bow of Rama's lord and draw it, so that my doubts may be cleared."* As Parasurama offered his bow it passed into Rama's hands of its own accord, and Parasurama felt amazed at this.

Glory to the Fire that consumes the forest of the demon race ! Glory to the Benefactor of gods, Brahmanas and cows ! Glory to Him who takes away pride, ignorance, passion and delusion ! Glory to Him who is an ocean of humility, amiability, compassion and goodness and a pastmaster in the art of speech. Glory to the Delighter of His servants and to Him who is graceful of every limb and whose form possesses the beauty of millions of Cupids ! How can I with one tongue utter Your praises? Glory to Him who sports in the mind of the great Lord Siva as a swan in the Manasarovara lake ! In my ignorance I have said much that was unseemly; therefore pardon me, both brothers, abodes of forgiveness that You are. Glory, glory, all glory to the Chief of Raghu's race !" So saying, the lord of Bhrgus withdrew to the forest to practise penance. The wicked kings were all seized with imaginary fears and the cowards quietly fled in all directions.

Troops of fair-faced, bright-eyed damsels sang melodious songs in chorus, their voice resembling the notes of the cuckoo. Janaka's joy was beyond description, as that of a born beggar who has found a treasure. Sita was rid of Her fears and was as glad as a young of a Cakora bird at the rising of the moon. Janaka made obeisance before Kausika and said, ''It is due to your grace, my lord, that Sri Rama has been able to break the bow. The two brothers have gained me my purpose; pray tell me now, reverend sir, what it behoves me to do." Said the sage, ''Listen, wise king: the marriage depended on the bow, and took place directly the bow broke, as is well-known to all, including gods, human beings and Nagas."
