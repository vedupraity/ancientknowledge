The king and his whole court were overwhelmed with emotion and began to offer lavish gifts to the messengers. They, however, closed their ears in protest crying, "This is unfair !" Everyone was delighted to note their sense of propriety.* </p> </div> <ul class=mb-5  > <li class=has-text-justified  > <strong>*</strong> In India not only the blood relations but even servants and co-villagers of a bride consider it sinful to accept even food or water, much less any gift or present, from the house of the bridegroom; for it is customary in this country to give the hand of a girl as a sacred gift and one is naturally reluctant to accept anything in return from him on whom a gift is made. This kind of sentiment prevails even in those cases where a marriage alliance has only been stipulated and not yet brought into actual effect. The messengers, in the above context, are actuated with a similar sentiment in refusing the gifts offered to them by King Daśaratha, who happened to be the father of the champion who had won the hand of Princess Jānakī, their master's daughter. </ul> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> taba uṭhi bhūpa basiṣṭha kahu dīnhi patrikā jāi. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> kathā sunāī gurahi saba sādara dūta bōlāi..293..

At the entrance of the king's palace, there was such an enormous crowd that a stone thrown there would be trodden into dust. Women viewed the sight from house-tops, carrying festal lights in salvers used on auspicious occasions, and carolled melodious strains of various kinds in an ecstasy of joy beyond description. Then Sumantra (King Daśaratha's own charioteer and trusted counsellor) got ready a pair of chariots and yoked them with steeds that would outrun even the horses of the sun-god, and brought them in all their splendour before the king; their beauty was more than goddess Śāradā could describe. One of them was equipped with the royal paraphernalia while the other was a mass of splendour and shone brightly. </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> tēhiṃ ratha rucira basiṣṭha kahu haraṣi caḍhaāi narēsu. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> āpu caḍhaēu spaṃdana sumiri hara gura gauri ganēsu..301..

The immortals rejoiced to see the marriage procession and rained down flowers full of auspicious blessings. There was a confused din of horses neighing, elephants trumpeting and music playing both in the heavens and in the procession. Human and celestial dames alike sang festal melodies, while clarionets played in sweet accord. There was an indescribable clamour of bells, both large and small. The footmen leaped and danced, displaying exercises of various kinds.

A fox turned round and showed himself again and again and a cow suckled its calf in front of the procession; a herd of deer came round to the right, as if good omens appeared in visible form.

In the marriage which was going to take place, the bridegroom was no other than Śrī Rāma and Sītā Herself was the bride; while the pious Daśaratha and Janaka were the parents of the bridegroom and the bride respectively; hearing of this marriage all good omens danced and said, "It is now that the Creator has justified us." In this way the procession set forth amidst the neighing of horses, the trumpeting of elephants and the clash of kettledrums. Learning that the chief of the solar race, King Daśaratha, was already on the way, King Janaka had the rivers bridged, and got beautiful rest-houses erected at different stages, which vied in magnificence with the city of immortals (Amarāvatī), and in which members of the bridegroom's party were supplied with excellent food, beds and clothing each according to his own taste.
