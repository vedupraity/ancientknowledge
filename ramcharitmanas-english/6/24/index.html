My name is Rāvaṇa, whose glory is known all the world over, and whose prison holds within its walls the regents of the spheres! You slew Khara, Dμusana and Viradha and killed poor Vali even as a hunter would shoot his game. Nay, you wiped out a host of demon champions and killed even Kumbhakarṇa and Meghanāda. Today I will, wreak vengeance on you for all this unless, O prince, you flee away from the battle. Today I will surely give you over to death; for it is the relentless Rāvaṇa whom you have to deal with."

Rāvaṇa ground his teeth out of frustration and hurled a fierce lance; but the Lord sent it back alongwith His arrow. The demon then cast a cloud of discs and tridents; but the Lord frustrated them by tearing them asunder without any exertion. Rāvaṇa's arrows proved as futile as the schemes of the wicked invariably are. Then with a hundred arrows he struck Śrī Rāma's charioteer (Matali), who fell to the ground crying "Victory to Śrī Rāma!"

Though bleeding profusely, the mighty demon rushed forward; the Lord once more fitted arrows to His bow. The Hero of Raghu's line discharged thirty shafts, which shot down his heads and arms to the ground. But they grew afresh as soon as they were severed; Śrī Rāma, however, struck off his heads and arms once more.

When the gods raised a piteous cry, the Lord took up His bow, full of wrath. Intercepting the enemy's arrows He struck off his heads, which covered all the quarters as well as the intermediate points of the compass, as well as heaven and earth. The severed heads flew through the air and struck terror into the monkeys' hearts as they uttered the cries of "Victory, Victory!! Where is Lakṣmaṇa? Where is Sugrīva, the lord of the monkeys? Where is the hero of Raghu's line, the lord of Kosala?" </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Chhands </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> kahaom rāmu kahi sira nikara dhāē dēkhi markaṭa bhaji calē. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> saṃdhāni dhanu raghubaṃsamani haomsi saranhi sira bēdhē bhalē.. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> sira mālikā kara kālikā gahi bṛṃda bṛṃdanhi bahu milīṃ. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> kari rudhira sari majjanu manahu saṃgrāma baṭa pūjana calīṃ.. </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class=has-text-justified > "Where is Rāma?" cried the multitudes of heads as they sped. The monkeys took to flight as they saw them. The Jewel of Raghu's line smilingly fitted arrows to His bow and shot the heads through and through. Taking a rosary of skulls in their hands a large number of Kalikas (female attendants of Goddess Kali) collected in numerous batches, as though having bathed in the stream of blood they had proceeded to worship the banyan tree of the battle. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pb-0"> <div class="box glass animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/6/23/" > Previous </a> <ul class=pagination-list > <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/6/1/" > 1 </a> <li> <span class=pagination-ellipsis >…</span> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/6/23/" > 23 </a> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" disabled > 24 </a> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/6/25/" > 25 </a> <li> <span class=pagination-ellipsis >…</span> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/6/36/" > 36 </a> </ul> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/6/25/" > Next </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box glass animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium is-centered" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-book" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (English)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/6/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>6 - Laṅkā Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a tabindex=-1  href=""> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-quote-right" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part 24</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <section aria-hidden=true  class="section pt-0 animatedParent animateOnce" > <article class="box message is-warning is-small p-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <div class="message-header is-justify-content-center"> <p>Copyright Notice</p> </div> <div class="message-body has-text-centered"> <p > Material used on this page belongs to and copyrighted under Gitapress, Gorakhpur. </p> </div> </article> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
