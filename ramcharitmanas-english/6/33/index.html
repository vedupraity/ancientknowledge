Now came the gods, ever alive to their own selfish interests, and spoke words as though they were seekers of the highest truth : "Friend of the meek, gracious, and divine Lord of the Raghus, you have shown mercy to the gods. This sensual wretch, who took delight in doing mischief to the whole world and trod the evil way, has perished through his own sins. You are alike to all, the imperishable Brahma, ever unchangeable, impartial by nature, integral, devoid of material properties, unborn, sinless, immutable, invincible, unfailing in power, and full of compassion. It was You who assumed the form of a fish, a tortoise; a boar, a man-lion and a dwarf as well as that of Parasurama. Whenever, O Lord, the gods have been in trouble, You have put an end to it by appearing in one form or other. This impure wretch, a perpetual enemy of the gods, was given up to lust, greed and vanity, and very passionate too. That even this vilest creature attained Your state is a marvel to us. We gods are supremely qualified (for the highest state): yet, devoted as we are to our own selfish ends, we have forgotten the worship of our lord and are ever involved in the flood of birth and death. Now redeem us, O Lord, since we have sought shelter in You."

Lord, You are a veritable lion to tear in pieces the elephant of mundane existence, and an ocean of virtues, my clever and omnipresent Master. In Your person stands concentrated the incomparable beauty of a myriad Cupids; Siddhas, as well as the greatest of sages and bards sing Your praises. Your glory is not only sacred, it purifies all; in Your wrath You seized Ravana even as Garuda (the king of the birds) might seize a huge serpent. Delight of devotees, and dispeller of their grief and fear, You are ever unmoved by passion, and are all- intelligence, my lord. Your descent on the mortal plane is beneficent and full of untold virtues: You come to relieve Earth's burdens and Your manifestations on earth are wisdom personified. (Though descended on earth,) You are ever unborn, omnipresent, one (without a second) and beginningless. I gladly bow to You, O Rama, fountain of mercy ! Ornament of Raghu's race and Slayer of demon Dμusana (Ravana's Cousin), You eradicate the faults of Your devotees and made Vibhisana, destitute as he was, the Ruler of Lanka. Storehouse of virtue and wisdom and beyond all measure, You have no pride in You and are unborn, all pervading and free from the taint of Maya; I constantly adore You, Rama. Terrible is the glory and might of Your arms, which are deft in exterminating the hordes of the impious. Compassionate and friendly to the poor without any ostensible reason and a reservoir of beauty, I adore You alongwith Rama (Sita). Deliverer from the rounds of birth and death, You are beyond both cause (Prakrti) and effect (the phenomenal universe) and eradicate the awful weaknesses of the (devotee's) mind. Armed with a charming bow, arrows, and quiver, You have eyes resembling a red lotus. A paragon of kings, home of bliss, Laksmi's lovely Consort, subduer of arrogance, lust and the false sense of mineness, You are free from blemish integral and imperceptible to the senses. Though manifest in all forms, You never transmuted Yourself into them all: so declare the Vedas; it is no mere gossip, as will be clear from the analogy of the sun and the sunshine, which are different and yet identical. Blessed are all these monkeys, O ubiquitous Lord, who reverently gaze on Your countenance; while accursed, O Hari, is our (so-called) immortal existence and our ethereal bodies in that we lack in devotion to You and are lost in worldly pleasures. Now show Your mercy to me, compassionate as You are to the afflicted, and take away my differentiating sense (which makes the world appear as apart from You), which leads me to wrong action and deluded by which I pass my days in merriment, mistaking woe for happiness. Destroyer of the wicked and lovely jewel of the earth, Your lotus feet are adored even by Sambhu (Lord Siva) and Uma (Goddess Parvati). O King of kings, grant me this boon that I may cherish loving devotion to Your lotus feet, which is a perennial source of blessings."

                                                            That very moment King Dasaratha appeared on the scene (in his celestial form); his eyes were flooded with tears as he beheld his son (Sri Rama). The Lord and His younger brother (Laksmana) made obeisance and the father in his turn gave them his blessing. "Dear father, it was all due to your religious merit that I conquered the invincible demon king." Dasaratha was overwhelmed with emotion when he heard his son's words; tears rushed to his eyes again and the hair on his body stood erect. The Lord of the Raghus understood that His father bore the same affection for Him as he did before; He, therefore, looked at His father and bestowed on him solid wisdom. Uma, (continues Lord Siva,) Dasaratha did not attain final beatitude for this simple reason that he set his heart on Devotion while maintaining his separate identity. Worshippers of God in His embodied form spurn final beatitude: to them Sri Rama vouchsafes devotion to His own person. Having prostrated himself before the Lord again and again, Dasaratha joyfully returned to his abode in heaven.

                                                            Glory to Sri Rama, beauty personified, the bestower of peace on the suppliant, equipped with an excellent bow, arrows and quiver and triumphing in His mighty strength of arm. Glory to the Slayer of Dμusana and Khara and the crusher of the demon hordes! Now that You have disposed of this wretch, my lord, all the gods enjoy full security. Glory to the Reliever of Earth's burden, whose greatness is beneficent and unbounded. Glory to the All-merciful Slayer of Ravana, who reduced the demon host to a miserable plight. Outrageous was the pride of Ravana (the lord of Lanka), who had subdued even gods and Gandharvas (the celestial musicians). Nay, he relentlessly pursued sages, the Siddhas, human beings, birds and Nagas alike. He took delight in injuring others and was most wicked; the vile sinner has now reaped the fruit of his misdeeds. Now listen, my lord, possessed of eyes as large as the lotus and compassionate to the humble: my pride was inordinate; I accounted no one as equal to me. At the sight of Your lotus feet, however, my pride, which entailed much woe, has taken leave of me. Some people meditate on the attributeless Brahma (the Absolute), whom the Vedas declare as unmanifest. What attracts my mind, however, is the Supreme embodied as Sri Rama, King of Kosala. Together with Videha's Daughter and Your younger brother (Laksmana), therefore, pray abide in my heart; and recognizing me as Your own servant, bless me with devotion, O Abode of Rama (Laksmi).

They have laid down their lives in my service: therefore, restore them all to life, O wise lord of the celestials." Listen, O king of the birds: (continues Kakabhusundi,) these words of the Lord are profoundly mysterious; only enlightened sages can apprehend them. The Lord Himself can wipe out the inhabitants of the three spheres and bring them back to life; He wished only to give Indra honour. By a shower of nectar the latter restored the monkeys and bears to life. They all arose with delight and betook themselves to the Lord. Although the shower of nectar promiscuously fell on the dead of both the armies, it is the bears and monkeys alone that returned to life, but not the demons. Their mind was absorbed in the thought of Sri Rama when they gave up the ghost; that is why they got liberated and were rid of the bonds of mundane existence. As for the monkeys and bears, they were all part manifestations of the gods (who are all immortal): hence they all came to life by the will of Sri Rama (the Lord of the Raghus). Is there anyone so kind to the afflicted as Sri Rama, who liberated the whole demon host? Even the wicked Ravana, who was a sink of impurities and given up to sensuality, attained to an exalted state which is withheld even from the greatest of sages.

A furious wind to disperse the mass of clouds in the shape of colossal ignorance, a fire to consume the forest of doubts, and delight of the gods, You are both with and without attributes, a shrine of virtues and most lovely to look at; nay, You are a burning midday Sun to scatter the darkness of delusion. A veritable lion to kill the elephants of lust, anger and pride, pray, constantly abide in the forest of the devotee's mind. A severe frost to blast the lotus bed of sensual desires, You are generous beyond conception. Nay, playing the role of Mount Mandara for churning the ocean of mundane existence, kindly stave off my fear (of birth and death) and transport me across the stormy ocean of mundane existence. Possessed of a swarthy form with lotus eyes, befriender of the meek, reliever of the suppliant's agony, take up Your abode in my heart for ever, O King Rama, with Your younger brother (Laksmana) and Janaka's Daughter, O Delight of the sages, Jewel of the terrestrial globe, lord of Tulasidasa and destroyer of fear.
