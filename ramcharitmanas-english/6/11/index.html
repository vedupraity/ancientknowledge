When the highly conceited Ravana heard it, he with a smile said, "Look at the insolence of these monkeys!" and summoned the demon host. "The monkeys have crossed over here driven by fate, and my demons are all hungry. God has provided them with a meal even at their home." So saying the idiot burst into a horselaugh. "Sally forth in every direction, champions all; and wherever you find the bears and monkeys seize and devour them all." Uma, Ravana's conceit was as great as that of the sandpiper, which goes to sleep with its legs in the air (and thinks that it will support the heavens in case they fall). Taking his orders, the demons sallied forth, armed with excellent slings, javelins, iron clubs and maces, fierce axes, pikes, swords, bludgeons and masses of rock in their hands. As foolish carnivorous birds swoop down upon a heap of rubies the moment they see it, and have no idea of the pain they would have on breaking their beaks against it, so did the man-eating monsters rush forth in their folly.

Martial drums and tabors sounded; the soul of the warriors was stirred by their crash. Numberless kettledrums and clarionets were also playing; their music cracked the heart of cowards. Advancing further, the demons saw the hosts of monkey and bear champions, exceptionally huge in size, who in their onrush would make no account of rugged valleys and catching hold of mountains would cleave them asunder and make passage through them. Gnashing their teeth and biting their lips, myriads of warriors on both sides roared and bullied, calling here on Rama and there on Ravana. With shouts of victory on both sides the fight actually commenced. The demons cast down volleys of mountain-peaks, which the monkeys would seize with a bound and hurl them back.

Darting against their adversary they would seize him by the leg and dash him to the ground; and in the event of his taking to flight they would challenge him to a duel again. The most agile and redoubtable monkeys and bears lightly sprang and climbed up the fort and penetrating the palaces sang Sri Rama's praises wherever they pleased.

They then climbed up the fort here and there and shouted glory to the Hero of Raghu's line, who was majestic as the sun. The demon host fled before them like a mass of clouds driven by a strong blast. The city now burst into wails and howls; children, invalids and women in particular wept aloud. All joined in calling Ravana names; he, they said, had invited death while enjoying sovereignty. When he heard that his troops had beaten a retreat, the king of Lanka rallied his champions and then exclaimed in fury: "If I hear of anyone turning his back on the battlefield, I will behead him with my own terrible sword. You consumed my all and enjoyed all sorts of luxuries till now and lo ! life has become so dear to you on the field of battle." The champions were all alarmed and put to shame to hear this stern rebuke, and marched against the enemy in great fury. To die in open combat is the glory of a warrior, they thought; and they loved their life no more.

One exclaimed, "Where are Angada and Hanuman? Where are the mighty Nala, Nila and Dvivida?" At the time Hanuman heard that his troops were breaking, that mighty warrior held his position at the western gate of Lanka, where Meghanada led the defence. The gate, however, would not give way and Hanuman was faced with a mighty impediment. The son of the wind-god grew terribly furious at heart and the warrior, who was formidable as death, gave a loud roar. He sprang and reached the fort of Lanka; and seizing a rock he rushed at Meghanada, shattered his chariot, overthrew the charioteer and kicked Meghanada himself at his chest. Another charioteer, who perceived the distress of the prince, picked him up in his own chariot and speedily brought him home.

Invoking in their heart the might of Sri Rama, both ran up to Ravana's own palace and proclaimed the victory of Kosala's lord. Holding the edifice in their hands they overthrew it with every pinnacle. The demon king was dismayed when he saw this. The women beat their breast with their hands crying: "This time the two pestilent monkeys have come!" Angada and Hanuman frightened them with their monkey-like pranks and proclaimed to them the glories of Sri Ramacandra. Then, grasping each a gold pillar in their hands, the two champions exclaimed, "Let us now begin upon our ravaging job!" Presently they roared and fell on the enemy's ranks and began to crush them with their mighty strength of arms, striking some with their foot and slapping another on the face and crying: "Take the consequences of not adoring Sri Rama!"

Vibhisana would mention their name and Sri Rama assigned even them a quarter in His own abode. Man-eating monsters who feasted on the flesh of holy Brahmanas thus attained a destiny which is solicited even by Yogis (ascetics given to contemplation on God). Uma, (continues Lord Siva,) Sri Rama is so tender-hearted and such a storehouse of compassion that He bestows the highest state (final beatitude) even on the demons, remembering that they think of Him even though in a spirit of hostility! Tell me, Bhavani, who else is so benignant? Most dull-witted and utterly wretched are the men who, even on hearing of such a lord, worship Him not, disabusing themselves of all delusion. "Angada and Hanuman have evidently forced their way into the fort of Lanka," thus observed Ayodhya's lord. Rampaging in Lanka, the two monkeys looked like a pair of Mandaras churning the ocean.

Sri Rama graciously regarded them both and presently their fatigue was gone and they felt supremely happy. On learning that Angada and Hanuman had left, the numerous monkey and bear warriors retired from the field; while the demons, recovering their strength at nightfall, sallied forth, calling on their ten-headed lord. At the sight of the demon host the monkeys turned again; and gnashing their teeth in fury the champions closed with their opponents here and there. The two armies stood formidable; their champion's challenging one another every time, came to a grim fight without giving in. The demons were all great warriors and dark in complexion; while the monkeys were stupendous in size and of numerous colours. The two armies were equally strong and the warriors too equally matched; displaying their martial feats they fought with fury and looked like masses of rainy and autumnal clouds driven against one another by a strong wind. The generals Akampana and Atikaya (sons of Ravana), when they perceived their troops losing ground, employed Maya (illusive devices); in an instant it grew pitch dark and there was a downpour of blood, stone and ashes.

                                                            The Lord of the Raghus understood the secret of it all and summoned Angada and Hanuman. He apprised them of all that was going on and issued necessary instructions to them. The two monkey chiefs rushed forth in a fury as soon as they heard the instructions. The All-merciful then drew His bow with a smile and forthwith let fly a flery dart. Lo! there was light all round and no trace of darkness left anywhere, even as doubts disappear with the dawn of spiritual enlightenment. The bear and monkeys were relieved of their fatigue and rid of all fear when they saw light again, and pressed on exultingly. Hanuman and Angada thundered on the field of battle and the demons fled at their menacing roar. But the bears and monkeys seized the demon warriors in their flight and dashed them to the ground, performing marvellous feats of strength even as they did so, or catching them by the leg, hurled them into the ocean, where alligators, serpents and fish snapped them up and devoured them.
