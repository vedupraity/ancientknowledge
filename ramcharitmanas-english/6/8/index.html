There was a cry in the whole city that the same monkey who had burnt down Laṅkā had come again. "Who knows what turn Providence is going to take?" everyone thought in excessive dismay.

There is one monkey, no doubt, of extraordinary might-he who came before and set fire to the city." On hearing this Vāli's son (Aṅgada) replied: "Tell me the truth, O demon king: is it a fact that a monkey burnt down your capital? A puny monkey set on fire Rāvaṇa's capital !

I am a respecter of merit and too magnanimous to pay any attention to your scurrilously glib talk." Said Aṅgada: "The son of the wind-god gave me a true account of your partiality to merit.

Remembering such amiability of your disposition I have been so insolent in my behaviour with you, O Rāvaṇa. On coming here I have witnessed all that Hanumān told me, viz., that you have no shame, no anger and no feeling of resentment." "It is because you possess such a mentality that you have proved to be the death of your own father." Uttering these words Rāvaṇa burst into a laughter. "Having been the death of my father I would have next claimed you as my victim; but a thought has come to me just now. Knowing you to be a living memorial of Vāli's unsullied fame, I desist from killing you, O vile boaster. Tell me, Rāvaṇa, how many Ravanas there are in the world? Or hear from me how many I have heard of. One went to the nether world (Pātāla) to conquer Bali and was tied up in the stables by the children, who made sport of him and thrashed him till Bali took compassion on him and had him released. Another again was discovered by King Sahasrabāhu, who ran and captured him as a strange creature and brought him home for the sake of fun.

He turned back much abashed at heart to hear this. All his splendour was gone and he was robbed of his glory even as the moon fades away at midday. With drooping heads he resumed his seat on the throne as if despoiled of all his riches. Śrī Rāma is the soul of the universe and the lord of life : how can he who is hostile to Him find any rest ? The universe, Umā (Pārvatī), springs into existence and is again dissolved with a mere play of Śrī Rāma's eyebrows.
