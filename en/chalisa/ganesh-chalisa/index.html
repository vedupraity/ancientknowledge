The other gods also gave you many boons including the wealth of wisdom.</p> <h5>buddhi parīkṣā jaba śiva kīnhā, pṛthvī kara pradakṣiṇā līnhā .</h5> <h5>cale ṣaḍānana, bharami bhulāī, race baiṭhi tuma buddhi upāī .. 16 ..</h5> <p>When Lord Śaṃkara tested Karthik and your intelligence, he told to go round the whole world.</p> <p>As soon as the order was given, Karthik immediately set out to circumnavigate the whole earth without thinking, but you found the solution by using your intelligence.</p> <h5>caraṇa mātu-pitu ke dhara līnheṃ, tinake sāta pradakṣiṇa kīnheṃ .</h5> <h5>dhani gaṇeśa kahi śiva hiye haraṣe, nabha te surana sumana bahu barase .. 17 ..</h5> <p>You touched the feet (as a gesture of expressing respect to elders) of your parents and made seven rounds around them.</p> <p>In this way Lord Śiva was so pleased seeing your wisdom and faith. Seeing this, the gods started showering flowers from the sky.</p> <h5>tumharī mahimā buddhi baḍaāī, śeṣa sahasamukha sake na gāī .</h5> <h5>maiṃ matihīna malīna dukhārī, karahuṃ kauna vidhi vinaya tumhārī .. 18 ..</h5> <p>O Lord Gaṇeśa you are great! even the thousand-headed serpent (Śeṣanāga) cannot praise your wisdom and glory.</p> <p>O Lord, I am a man without intelligence, a sinner, and I am sad, in what way should I pray.</p> <h5>bhajata rāmasundara prabhudāsā, jaga prayāga kakarā durvāsā .</h5> <h5>aba prabhu dayā dīnā para kījai, apanī bhakti śakti kucha dījai .. 19 ..</h5> <p>O Lord, your servant (devotee) Rāmsundara always remembers you.

Ganesha is considered the Lord of all beginnings and the last resort of obstacles. He is worshiped as the god of good fortune, new ventures and knowledge. Ganesh Chalisa is a religious hymn dedicated to Lord Ganesha.</p> <p>The devotional songs with forty verses are written in Sanskrit language and address the Lord by many names and remember his great deeds. The hymn was completed by Sundardas in Vikram Samvat to demonstrate his affection for the Lord. Ganesh Chalisa is the most widely read Hindu prayer. Many devotees chant the holy verses as a daily prayer. It is believed that those who sing this prayer with pure devotion are bestowed with wealth, knowledge and prosperity in no time.</p> <p>The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is considered very sacred in Sanatan Dharma. Every year this festival is celebrated on the Chaturthi Tithi (4th day) of Shukla Paksha (The first fortnight between New Moon Day and Full Moon Day) of Bhadrapada month (corresponds to August/September) as the birth anniversary of Shri Ganesh.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/chalisa"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Chalisa (Poetry)</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/chalisa/ganesh-chalisa"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Ganesh Chalisa</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-title> Select language </swal-title> <swal-input type=select  value=hi  /> <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/language-selector.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
