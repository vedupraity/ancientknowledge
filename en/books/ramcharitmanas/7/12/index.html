Garuḍa&rsquo;s delusion; Garuḍa listens to Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s story and to an account of His glory from Kākabhuśuṇḍi</h4> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>girijā sunahu bisada yaha kathā. maiṃ saba kahī mōri mati jathā..</h5> <h5>rāma carita sata kōṭi apārā. śruti sāradā na baranai pārā..

[7-51-4]</h5> <h5>dhanya dhanya maiṃ dhanya purārī. sunēu rāma guna bhava bhaya hārī.. [7-51-5]</h5> <p>Listen, Girijā; (continues Lord Śaṅkara,) &ldquo;I have told you in full this holy narrative according to My own lights. The stories of Śrī Rāma are without number and beyond all dimensions. Not even the Vedas and Śāradā (the goddess of speech) could recount them all. Infinite is Rāma and infinite His excellences; His births, exploits and names too are endless. It may be possible to count the drops of water (in a shower of rain) or the grains of sand; but the exploits of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus) cannot be recounted in full. This sacred story enables one to reach the abode of Śrī Hari; whoever hears it is blessed with unceasing devotion. Umā, (goes on Lord Śiva,) I have repeated in full the delightful story which Bhuśuṇḍi recited to the king of the birds. I have thus recounted a few of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s virtues; let me know, Bhavānī (Pārvatī), what am I to tell you next.&rdquo; Umā was glad to have heard the blessed story and replied in exceedingly polite and soft accents : &ldquo;I am thrice blessed, O Slayer of the demon Tripura, to have heard Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s praises, that take away the fear of birth and death.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>tumharī kṛpāom kṛpāyatana aba kṛtakṛtya na mōha.</h5> <h5>jānēu rāma pratāpa prabhu cidānaṃda saṃdōha..52ka.. [7-52(A)]</h5> <h5>nātha tavānana sasi sravata kathā sudhā raghubīra.</h5> <h5>śravana puṭanhi mana pāna kari nahiṃ aghāta matidhīra..52kha.. [7-52(B)]</h5> <p>By Your grace, O Abode of mercy, I have now attained the object of my life and have no delusion left in me. I have realized the greatness of Lord Śrī Rāma, who is knowledge and bliss personified. O lord of resolute mind, my soul knows no satiety as I quaff with the cups of my ears the nectar-like story of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line) flowing from Your moon-like mouth.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>rāma carita jē sunata aghāhīṃ. rasa bisēṣa jānā tinha nāhīṃ..</h5> <h5>jīvanamukta mahāmuni jēū. hari guna sunahīṃ niraṃtara tēū.. [7-52(B)-1]</h5> <h5>bhava sāgara caha pāra jō pāvā. rāma kathā tā kahaom dṛḍha nāvā..</h5> <h5>biṣainha kahaom puni hari guna grāmā. śravana sukhada aru mana abhirāmā..

[7-52(B)-4]</h5> <p>They who feel satiated with hearing the exploits of Śrī Rāma have little known their peculiar sapor. Even those great sages who have attained final beatitude in their very lifetime constantly hear the praises of Śrī Hari. To him who seeks to cross the ocean of worldly existence, the narrative of Śrī Rāma serves as a secure bark. Nay, the praises of Śrī Hari are delightful to the ear and pleasing to the mind even of the sensualist. Is there in this world anyone with ears to hear, whom the exploits of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus) do not delight. Stupid are those creatures and indeed killers of their soul, whom the narrative of Śrī Rāma does not attract.&rdquo; While You sang what You have chosen to call, &ldquo;the Mānasa Lake of Śrī Hari&rsquo;s exploits&rdquo; I listened, my lord, with boundless joy. You have just told me that this charming story was recited by Kākabhuśuṇḍi to Garuḍa.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>birati gyāna bigyāna dṛḍha rāma carana ati nēha.</h5> <h5>bāyasa tana raghupati bhagati mōhi parama saṃdēha..53.. [7-53]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Bhuśuṇḍi is staunch in his dispassion and steadfast in his wisdom and realization, and cherishes deep devotion to Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet. That one possessing the form of a crow should be a devotee of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus) fills me with great doubt.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>nara sahastra mahaom sunahu purārī. kōu ēka hōi dharma bratadhārī..</h5> <h5>dharmasīla kōṭika mahaom kōī. biṣaya bimukha birāga rata hōī..

[7-53-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Listen, O Slayer of demon Tripura : among a thousand men there is scarce one who is steadfast in his vow of piety. Among ten million souls devoted to religion there may be one who is averse to the pleasures of sense and takes delight in dispassion. Among ten million souls free from worldly attachment, so declare the Vedas, scarce one succeeds in acquiring perfect wisdom. Among ten million enlightened souls in this world there is hardly one who attains final beatitude even when living. Among a thousand such souls he who has not only realized his oneness with Brahma but merged his identity in the Absolute and has accordingly become a fountain of all joy is rarely to be found. Of the religious, the unattached, the enlightened and the emancipated, as well as of those merged in the Absolute, O lord of divinities, he who takes delight in devotion to Śrī Rāma and is free from vanity and wiles is most difficult to find.&rdquo; Kindly explain to me at length, O Lord of the universe, how such a devotion to Śrī Hari was attained by a crow.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>rāma parāyana gyāna rata gunāgāra mati dhīra.</h5> <h5>nātha kahahu kēhi kārana pāyau kāka sarīra..54.. [7-54]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Also tell me, my lord, how did Bhuśuṇḍi obtain the form of a crow even though devoted to Śrī Rāma, steeped in wisdom, a home of virtues and resolute of mind?</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>yaha prabhu carita pavitra suhāvā. kahahu kṛpāla kāga kahaom pāvā..</h5> <h5>tumha kēhi bhāomti sunā madanārī. kahahu mōhi ati kautuka bhārī..

[7-54-5]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Further tell me, O merciful lord, wherefrom did the crow get this sacred and delightful story? And also let me know how could You hear it, O Destroyer of Cupid: for all this fills me with much inquisitiveness. Garuḍa, again, is highly enlightened and an embodiment of virtues; moreover, he is a servant of Śrī Hari (being His own mount) and lives very close to Him. Leaving a host of sages, wherefore did he approach a crow and hear Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s story from him? Further let me know how the dialogue proceeded between the crow and Garuḍa (the devourer of serpents), both of whom are devotees of Śrī Hari.&rdquo; Lord Śiva rejoiced to hear the artless and welcome speech of His Consort (Gaurī) and politely replied, &ldquo;You are blessed indeed, O virtuous lady; your idea is holy, and you possess not a little love for the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). Therefore, listen to a most sacred story, which, when heard, puts an end to the delusion of the whole universe, engenders faith in Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet and enables a man to cross the ocean of worldly existence without any difficulty.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>aisia prasna bihaṃgapati kīnha kāga sana jāi.</h5> <h5>sō saba sādara kahihau sunahu umā mana lāi..55.. [7-55]</h5> <p>The king of the birds too went and put quite similar questions to the crow. I will reverently tell you all that: listen, Umā with an attentive mind.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>maiṃ jimi kathā sunī bhava mōcani. sō prasaṃga sunu sumukhi sulōcani..</h5> <h5>prathama daccha gṛha tava avatārā. satī nāma taba rahā tumhārā..

[7-55-4]</h5> <h5>tinha para ēka ēka biṭapa bisālā. baṭa pīpara pākarī rasālā..</h5> <h5>sailōpari sara suṃdara sōhā. mani sōpāna dēkhi mana mōhā.. [7-55-5]</h5> <p>Listen, O charming and bright-eyed lady, to the circumstances in which I heard this story, that delivers one from the cycle of births and deaths. You first took birth in the house of Dakṣa and Sati was the name you then bore. At Dakṣa&rsquo;s sacrifice you were subjected to contumely and in the heat of your indignation you gave up your life then. My servants wrecked the sacrifice : you know the whole episode already. I felt much troubled at heart thereafter; for your loss had left me disconsolate, my dear. I wandered among beautiful woodlands, mountains, rivers and tanks seeing sights, but found no charm anywhere. In the far north, even beyond Mount Sumeru, there stands a most lovely mountain, known by the name of Nīlagiri (the Blue Mountain). It has four charming and delightful gold peaks, which gladdened my soul : on each stood one gigantic tree, a banyan, a Peepul (the sacred bo-tree), a Plakṣa (the Indian fig tree) and a mango. On the top of the mountain sparkled a beautiful tarn with jewelled steps, which were so enchanting to behold.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sītala amala madhura jala jalaja bipula bahuraṃga.</h5> <h5>kūjata kala rava haṃsa gana guṃjata majuṃla bhṛṃga..56.. [7-56]</h5> <p>Its water was cool, limpid and sweet; its lotuses abundant and many coloured. Flocks of swans murmured their sweet notes and the bees made a delightful buzzing.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>tēhiṃ giri rucira basai khaga sōī. tāsu nāsa kalpāṃta na hōī..</h5> <h5>māyā kṛta guna dōṣa anēkā. mōha manōja ādi abibēkā.. [7-56-1]</h5> <h5>rahē byāpi samasta jaga māhīṃ. tēhi giri nikaṭa kabahu nahiṃ jāhīṃ..</h5> <h5>tahaom basi harihi bhajai jimi kāgā. sō sunu umā sahita anurāgā.. [7-56-2]</h5> <h5>pīpara taru tara dhyāna sō dharaī. jāpa jagya pākari tara karaī..</h5> <h5>āomba chāhaom kara mānasa pūjā. taji hari bhajanu kāju nahiṃ dūjā.. [7-56-3]</h5> <h5>bara tara kaha hari kathā prasaṃgā. āvahiṃ sunahiṃ anēka bihaṃgā..</h5> <h5>rāma carita bicītra bidhi nānā. prēma sahita kara sādara gānā.. [7-56-4]</h5> <h5>sunahiṃ sakala mati bimala marālā. basahiṃ niraṃtara jē tēhiṃ tālā..</h5> <h5>jaba maiṃ jāi sō kautuka dēkhā. ura upajā ānaṃda bisēṣā.. [7-56-5]</h5> <p>On that splendid mountain dwells the same bird (Kākabhuśuṇḍi), that outlives even the end of the world. The various good and evil phenomena created by Māyā (the Cosmic Illusion), and ignorance in its varied forms such as infatuation,lust etc., which hold sway all over the universe, never touch the precincts of that mountain. Now hear, Umā, with tender affection how the crow spends his days there in adoring Śrī Hari. Under the Peepul tree he practises meditation; he performs secrifice in the form of Japa (muttering of prayers) under the Plakṣa; in the shade of the mango tree he offers mental worship to the Lord, having no occupation other than adoring Śrī Hari; and under the banyan he narrates episodes from the story of Śrī Hari, to hear which many a bird flocks there. With loving reverence he sings the various marvellous exploits of Śrī Rāma; the swans of pure mind, that ever dwell in that lake, all listen to the story. When I arrived there and saw the spectacle, an intense joy welled up in my heart.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>taba kachu kāla marāla tanu dhari tahaom kīnha nivāsa.</h5> <h5>sādara suni raghupati guna puni āyau kailāsa..57.. [7-57]</h5> <p>Then, assuming the form of a swan, I sojourned there for some length of time. And, after reverently listening to the praises of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), I returned to Kailāsa.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>girijā kahēu sō saba itihāsā. maiṃ jēhi samaya gayau khaga pāsā..</h5> <h5>aba sō kathā sunahu jēhī hētū. gayau kāga pahiṃ khaga kula kētū.. [7-57-1]</h5> <h5>jaba raghunātha kīnhi rana krīḍaā. samujhata carita hōti mōhi brīḍaā..</h5> <h5>iṃdrajīta kara āpu baomdhāyō. taba nārada muni garuḍa paṭhāyō..

[7-57-4]</h5> <p>Girijā, I have thus narrated the whole episode as to when I visited the bird (Kākabhuśuṇḍi). Now hear the circumstances under which Garuḍa (the glory of the feathered kingdom) called on the crow. When the Lord of the Raghus enacted the sport of a combat (with Meghanāda, Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s son)-the very thought of which fills me with shame-and allowed Himself to be bound by Meghanāda (the conqueror of Indra), the sage Nārada despatched Garuḍa. When Garuḍa (the devourer of serpents) had cut the bonds and departed a terrible dejection possessed his soul. Racalling the Lord&rsquo;s bondage, the enemy of the serpents thought over the incident in many ways : &ldquo;It was the all-pervading and passionless Brahma, the lord of speech, the supreme Ruler beyond Māyā and error, who had, I was told, taken descent in this world. But I saw none of His divine glory</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhava baṃdhana tē chūṭahiṃ nara japi jā kara nāma.</h5> <h5>kharca nisācara bāomdhēu nāgapāsa sōi rāma..58.. [7-58]</h5> <p>&ldquo;The same Rāma, by repeating whose Name men get freedom from the bonds of worldly existence was tied down by a puny demon with coils of snakes !&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>nānā bhāomti manahi samujhāvā. pragaṭa na gyāna hṛdayaom bhrama chāvā..</h5> <h5>khēda khinna mana tarka baḍhaāī. bhayau mōhabasa tumharihiṃ nāī.. [7-58-1]</h5> <h5>byākula gayau dēvariṣi pāhīṃ. kahēsi jō saṃsaya nija mana māhīṃ..</h5> <h5>suni nāradahi lāgi ati dāyā. sunu khaga prabala rāma kai māyā.. [7-58-2]</h5> <h5>jō gyāninha kara cita apaharaī. bariāī bimōha mana karaī..</h5> <h5>jēhiṃ bahu bāra nacāvā mōhī. sōi byāpī bihaṃgapati tōhī.. [7-58-3]</h5> <h5>mahāmōha upajā ura tōrēṃ. miṭihi na bēgi kahēṃ khaga mōrēṃ..</h5> <h5>caturānana pahiṃ jāhu khagēsā. sōi karēhu jēhi hōi nidēsā.. [7-58-4]</h5> <p>Garuḍa did all he could to reassure himself; but the light of wisdom did not dawn on him; on the other hand,error overshadowed his soul all the more. Torn by torments and full of mental questionings, he fell a prey to delusion just like yourself. In his perplexity he approached the celestial sage (Nārada) and apprized him of the doubt that preyed upon his mind. On hearing his tale Nārada was moved with great compassion and said, &ldquo;Listen, Garuḍa: formidable is Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s Māyā (delusive power); it robs even the wise of their sense and bringing them under its sway clouds their mind with utter infatuation. The same Māyā that befooled me many a time has laid its hold on you, O lord of the feathered creation. A blinding infatuation has taken root in your heart and it will not be readily eradicated by any words of mine. Therefore, betake yourself to Brahmā (the four-faced Creator), O lord of the winged creatures, and do whatever he enjoins you.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>asa kahi calē dēvariṣi karata rāma guna gāna.</h5> <h5>hari māyā bala baranata puni puni parama sujāna..59.. [7-59]</h5> <p>So saying the most enlightened celestial sage went his way, chanting Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s praises and repeatedly recalling to his mind the power of Śrī Hari&rsquo;s Māyā.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>taba khagapati biraṃci pahiṃ gayaū. nija saṃdēha sunāvata bhayaū..</h5> <h5>suni biraṃci rāmahi siru nāvā. samujhi pratāpa prēma ati chāvā.. [7-59-1]</h5> <h5>mana mahu karai bicāra bidhātā. māyā basa kabi kōbida gyātā..</h5> <h5>hari māyā kara amiti prabhāvā. bipula bāra jēhiṃ mōhi nacāvā.. [7-59-2]</h5> <h5>aga jagamaya jaga mama uparājā. nahiṃ ācaraja mōha khagarājā..</h5> <h5>taba bōlē bidhi girā suhāī. jāna mahēsa rāma prabhutāī..

[7-59-4]</h5> <p>The lord of the feathered creation then went to the Creator and told him his doubt. On hearing his story Brahma bowed his head to Śrī Rāma and, realizing His might, was overwhelmed with love. The Creator mused within himself : &ldquo;The seers and sages as well as the learned are all dominated by Māyā. Unbounded is the power of Śrī Hari&rsquo;s Māyā, that has often made a puppet of me. The whole of this animate and inanimate creation was evolved by me; no wonder, then, that the king of the birds has been beguiled by it.&rdquo; Thereupon Brahma said in charming accents, &ldquo;The great Lord Śiva is conversant with Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s glory. Therefore, O son of Vinatā, approach Lord Śaṅkara and ask no question of anyone elsewhere, dear child. There alone will your doubts be resolved.&rdquo; On hearing the Creator&rsquo;s advice the bird flew away.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>paramātura bihaṃgapati āyau taba mō pāsa.</h5> <h5>jāta rahēu kubēra gṛha rahihu umā kailāsa..60.. [7-60]</h5> <p>Then came the lord of the feathered kingdom in utmost distress to me. At that time I was on my way to Kubera&rsquo;s residence; while you, Umā, were here on Mount Kailāsa.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>tēhiṃ mama pada sādara siru nāvā. puni āpana saṃdēha sunāvā..</h5> <h5>suni tā kari binatī mṛdu bānī. parēma sahita maiṃ kahēu bhavānī..

[7-60-4]</h5> <p>He reverently bowed his head at my feet and then placed his doubt before me. On hearing his submission, which was couched in polite terms, Bhavānī, I lovingly replied to him, &ldquo;Garuḍa, you have met me on the way; how then, shall I instruct you? Doubts are wholly resolved only when one enjoys the fellowship of saints for a long time, and listens there to the delightful story of Śrī Hari, that has been sung by the sages in diverse ways and the sole theme of which-at the beginning, in the middle as well as at the end-is the divine Lord Śrī Rāma. I shall accordingly send you to a place where, O brother, the story of Śrī Hari is recited everyday; you go there and listen. As you hear it all your doubts will vanish and you will develop intense love for Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>binu satasaṃga na hari kathā tēhi binu mōha na bhāga.</h5> <h5>mōha gaēom binu rāma pada hōi na dṛḍha anurāga..61..

And till one&rsquo;s error is dispersed one cannot have deep-rooted affection for Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>milahiṃ na raghupati binu anurāgā. kiēom jōga tapa gyāna birāgā..</h5> <h5>uttara disi suṃdara giri nīlā. tahaom raha kākabhusuṃḍi susīlā..

[7-61-5]</h5> <p>The Lord of the Raghus cannot be found except through love, even though you may practise Yoga (mind-control) or austere penance or culivate spiritual wisdom or dispassion. In the north there is a beautiful blue mountain called Nīlagiri, where lives the amiable Kākabhuśuṇḍi, highly conversant with the path of Devotion to Śrī Rāma, enlightened, full of all good qualities and ages old. He unceasingly recites Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s narrative and noble birds of different species reverently listen to it. Go there and hear of the many virtues of Śrī Hari; your distress born of infatuation will thus disappear.&rdquo; When I had thus told him everything in unambiguous terms, Garuḍa bowed his head at my feet and departed with joy. Umā, I did not instruct him myself, because by the grace of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus) I had come to know the secret (of Garuḍa&rsquo;s infatuation). He must have given vent to his pride on some ocassion and the All-merciful evidently wished to cure him of it. Partly there was another reason why I did not detain him; a bird can follow the language of a bird alone. My lord&rsquo;s Māyā, Bhavānī, is formidable; who is there so wise as not to be beguiled by it?&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>gyāni bhagata sirōmani tribhuvanapati kara jāna.</h5> <h5>tāhi mōha māyā nara pāvaomra karahiṃ gumāna..62ka..

[7-62(B)]</h5> <p>Even Garuḍa, the very crest-jewel of devotees and enlightened souls and the mount of Lord Viṣṇu (the sovereign of the three spheres), was deluded by Māyā how absurd, then, the poor mortals vaunt their immunity from it. The Lord&rsquo;s Māyā beguiles even Śiva and Brahma; of what account in any poor creature? Bearing this in mind, the sages adore the divine Lord of Māyā.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>gayau garuḍa jahaom basai bhusuṃḍā. mati akuṃṭha hari bhagati akhaṃḍā..</h5> <h5>dēkhi saila prasanna mana bhayaū. māyā mōha sōca saba gayaū..

[7-62(B)-4]</h5> <p>Garuḍa went to the abode of Bhuśuṇḍi (Kākabhuśuṇḍi) of unhampered intellect and possessing uninterrupted devotion to Śrī Hari. At the sight of the mountain his heart rejoiced and he was rid of all Māyā (delusion), infatuation and anxiety. After bathing in the tarn and drinking of its water he betook himself under the banyan tree, delighted at heart. Aged birds of all kinds flocked there to hear Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s charming exploits. Bhuśuṇḍi was just on the point of commencing the narration when the king of the birds arrived. All were rejoiced to see the king of the whole feathered creation approach, the crow no less than the rest of the assembly. Bhuśuṇḍi received the king of the birds with the utmost reverence and, having enquired after his welfare, conducted him to an exalted seat. After offering him loving worship the crow addressed him in honeyed accents:-</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>nātha kṛtāratha bhayau maiṃ tava darasana khagarāja.</h5> <h5>āyasu dēhu sō karauṃ aba prabhu āyahu kēhi kāja..63ka..

With what object have you come, my master ?&rdquo; &ldquo;You have always been a picture of blessedness,&rdquo; replied the lord of the feathered kingdom in gentle phrase, &ldquo;as I find that the great Lord Śiva reverently extolled you with His own mouth.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sunahu tāta jēhi kārana āyau. sō saba bhayau darasa tava pāyau..</h5> <h5>dēkhi parama pāvana tava āśrama. gayau mōha saṃsaya nānā bhrama..

Now, dear one, narrate to me with due reverence the most sacred story of Śrī Rāma, which is ever delightful and a cure for all sufferings. This is what I beg of you again and again.&rdquo; The moment Bhuśuṇḍi heard Garuḍa&rsquo;s prayer, humble, sincere, loving; delightful and pious, a supreme joy diffused over his soul and he commenced recounting the virtues of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). First of all, with fervent devotion, O Bhavānī, he gave an elaborate description of the lake of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s exploits. Next he told about Nārada&rsquo;s terrible infatuation and then of Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s incarnation. Thereafter he sang the story of the Lord&rsquo;s descent and then recounted with deep interest His childlike sports.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bālacarita kahiṃ bibidha bidhi mana mahaom parama uchāha.</h5> <h5>riṣi āgavana kahēsi puni śrī raghubīra bibāha..64.. [7-64]</h5> <p>After narrating His boyish sports of various kinds with the utmost rapture of soul he told of the sage&rsquo;s (Viśvāmitra&rsquo;s) arrival and thereafter of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s wedding.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bahuri rāma abhiṣēka prasaṃgā. puni nṛpa bacana rāja rasa bhaṃgā..</h5> <h5>purabāsinha kara biraha biṣādā. kahēsi rāma lachimana saṃbādā..

[7-64-4]</h5> <p>Then he narrated the episode of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s projected installaion (as the PrinceRegent of Ayodhyā) and after that he spoke of the sudden interruption in the festivities connected with the installation due to King Daśaratha&rsquo;s solemn pledge (to Kaikeyī), as well as of the citizens&rsquo; agony at Rāma&rsquo;s parting. He then reproduced the dialogue between Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa and further described their journey to the forest, the devotion of the boatman and their ferrying across the celestial stream (Gaṅgā) and halt at Prayāga. He further described the Lord&rsquo;s meeting with the sage Vālmīki and how the divine Śrī Rāma sojourned at Citrakūṭa. Again, he then told of the minister&rsquo;s (Sumantra&rsquo;s) return to the capital, the King&rsquo;s demise, Bharata&rsquo;s coming back (from his maternal grandfather&rsquo;s) as well as his abundant love (for Śrī Rāma). He further related how after performing the King&rsquo;s obsequies Bharata with all the citizens betook himself to where the All-blissful Lord was, and how when the Lord of the Raghus consoled him in every way he took the Lord&rsquo;s sandals and returned to the city of Ayodhyā. Bhuśuṇḍi continued and described Bharata&rsquo;s mode of life (at Nandigrama), the (mischievous) conduct of Jayanta (the son of Indra, the lord of the celestials) and the Lord&rsquo;s meeting with the sage Atri.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kahi birādha badha jēhi bidhi dēha tajī sarabhaṃga..</h5> <h5>barani sutīchana prīti puni prabhu agasti satasaṃga..65..

[7-65-4]</h5> <p>After speaking about the purification of the Daṇḍaka forest Bhuśuṇḍi told of the Lord&rsquo;s friendship with the vulture king (Jaṭāyu). He further narrated how the Lord took up His abode at Pañcavaṭī and dissipated the fears of all the hermits. Then came the Lord&rsquo;s incomparable exhortation to Lakṣmaṇa and the story of Śūrpaṇakhā&rsquo;s mutilation. He further narrated the death of Khara and Dūṣaṇa (at the Lord&rsquo;s hands) and how Rāvaṇa (the ten-headed monster) got all the information. Again, he then told all the particulars of the latter&rsquo;s talk with Mārīca. Thereafter he described the abduction of the fictitious Sītā and briefly referred to the desolation of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line). After this he told how the Lord performed the Obsequies of the vulture king, slew the demon Kabandha and bestowed the highest state (final beatitude) on Śabarī (the Bhīla woman), and further narrated how the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line went to the bank of the Pampā lake, bewailing His desolation all the way.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>prabhu nārada saṃbāda kahi māruti milana prasaṃga.</h5> <h5>puni sugrīva mitāī bāli prāna kara bhaṃga..66ka..

He further related how after installing Sugrīva (on the throne of Kiṣkindhā) the Lord took up His abode on Mount Pravarṣaṇa, gave an account of the rains as well as of the autumn that immediately followed and told of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s wrath on Sugrīva and the latter&rsquo;s dismay</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>jēhi bidhi kapipati kīsa paṭhāē. sītā khōja sakala disi dhāē..</h5> <h5>bibara prabēsa kīnha jēhi bhāomtī. kapinha bahōri milā saṃpātī..

He further narrated how the gods with joined palms hymned the Lord&rsquo;s praises, how the All-merciful Lord then mounted the aerial car known by the name of Puṣpaka alongwith the monkeys and flew to Ayodhyā and how Śrī Rāma arrived at His own capital and all such holy doings. He then told of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s coronation and also described the city and all its kingly polity. In this way Bhuśuṇḍi narrated the whole story as I have already told you, Bhavānī. When he heard the whole of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s narrative, Garuḍa&rsquo;s mind was filled with rapture and he spoke as follows:-</p> <h4>Sortas</h4> <h5>gayau mōra saṃdēha sunēu sakala raghupati carita.</h5> <h5>bhayau rāma pada nēha tava prasāda bāyasa tilaka..68ka..

Had I not thus fallen a prey to gross infatuation, how could it have been possible for me to meet you, revered sir, and how could I get an opportunity to hear the charming and most wonderful story of Śrī Hari that you have just sung in all its details. The Vedas, the Tantras and the Purāṇas are at one on this point and so declare the Siddhas and sages in unequivocal terms that the fellowship of genuine saints is only attained by those whom Śrī Rāma regards with favour.

[7-70(B)-4]</h5> <p>Who is not thrown out of his mental equipoise by the combined action of the three Guṇas (modes of Prakṛti) as by the synchronous derangement of the three humours of the body (which generally proves fatal to the victim according to the principles of ayurveda)? None has escaped the stings of pride and arrogance. Who does not get wildly excited under an attack of fever in the form of youth and whose good reputation is not marred by worldly attachment? Who does not incur obloquy through envy and who is not shaken by the blast of grief? Who is not bitten by the serpent of care? And is there anyone in this world who is not overcome by Māyā (the delusive potency of God)? Again, is there anyone so resolute of mind, whose body is not being consumed by desire as a piece of wood is eaten away by a wooded-borer? Whose mind has not been polluted by the threefold desire-the desire of progeny, the desire of wealth and the desire of fame? All these constitute the retinue of Māyā, formidable and infinite in number, more than any can tell. Even Lord Śiva and the four-faced Brahmā (the Creator) are ever afraid of these; of what account, then, are other creatures?</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>byāpi rahēu saṃsāra mahu māyā kaṭaka pracaṃḍa..</h5> <h5>sēnāpati kāmādi bhaṭa daṃbha kapaṭa pāṣaṃḍa..71ka.. [7-71(A)]</h5> <h5>sō dāsī raghubīra kai samujhēṃ mithyā sōpi.</h5> <h5>chūṭa na rāma kṛpā binu nātha kahau pada rōpi..71kha.. [7-71(B)]</h5> <p>Māyā&rsquo;s formidable army is spread over the whole universe. Concupiscence and others (viz., Anger and Greed) are its generals; Hypocrisy, Deceit and Heresy its champions. That Māyā, however, is Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s own handmaid; though unreal when understood, there is no release from her grip except by Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s grace: I declare this with the utmost confidence.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>jō māyā saba jagahi nacāvā. jāsu carita lakhi kāhu na pāvā..</h5> <h5>sōi prabhu bhrū bilāsa khagarājā. nāca naṭī iva sahita samājā..

[7-71(B)-4]</h5> <p>The same Māyā that has made a puppet of the whole world and whose ways are unknown to anyone, dences with all her troups like an actress on the stage to the play of the Lord&rsquo;s eyebrows, O king of birds. Such is Śrī Rāma, who is devoid of birth, the totality of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, wisdom personified, the home of beauty and strength. He is both pervading and pervaded, fractionless, infinite and integral, the Lord of unfailing power, attributeless, vast, transcending speech as well as the other senses, all-seeing, free from blemish, invincible, unattached, devoid of form, free from error, eternal and untainted by Māyā, beyond the realm of Prakṛti (Matter), bliss personified, the Lord indwelling the heart of all, the actionless Brahma, free from passion and imperishable. In Him error finds no ground to stand upon; can the shades of darkness ever approach the sun?</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhagata hētu bhagavāna prabhu rāma dharēu tanu bhūpa.</h5> <h5>kiē carita pāvana parama prākṛta nara anurūpa..72ka.. [7-72(A)]</h5> <h5>jathā anēka bēṣa dhari nṛtya karai naṭa kōi.</h5> <h5>sōi sōi bhāva dēkhāvai āpuna hōi na sōi..72kha.. [7-72(B)]</h5> <p>For the sake of His devotees, the divine Lord Śrī Rāma took the form of an earthly sovereign and performed most sacred deeds, in the manner of an ordinary mortal, even as an actor, while acting on the stage, assumes various guises and exhibits different characters but himself remains the same.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>asi raghupati līlā uragārī. danuja bimōhani jana sukhakārī..</h5> <h5>jē mati malina biṣayabasa kāmī. prabhu mōha dharahiṃ imi svāmī..

[7-72(B)-4]</h5> <h5>tē saṭha haṭha basa saṃsaya karahīṃ. nija agyāna rāma para dharahīṃ.. [7-72(B)-5]</h5> <p>Such, O enemy of serpents, is the pastime of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), a bewilderment to the demons but a delight to His servants. Those who are impure of mind, given over to the pleasures of sense and slaves of passion attribute infatuation to the Lord in the following manner, my master. He who has a jaundiced eye declares the moon as of a yellow colour so long as the disease is there. When a man is bewildered as to the point of the compass, O Garuḍa, he affirms that the sun has risen in the west. A man who is sailing on a boat finds the world moving and deludes himself with the idea that he himself is standing still. Children whirl round in play, but not the surrounding buildings etc., yet they dub one another a liar (when some of them insist that it is they themselves who are moving). It is in this way, O king of the birds, that error is ascribed to Śrī Hari; otherwise not even in a dream is He subject to delusion. Those dull-witted wretches who are dominated by Māyā and who have many a veil hanging over their soul, such fools alone raise doubts in their perversity and ascribe their own ignorance to Śrī Rāma.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kāma krōdha mada lōbha rata gṛhāsakta dukharūpa.</h5> <h5>tē kimi jānahiṃ raghupatihi mūḍha parē tama kūpa..73ka.. [7-73(A)]</h5> <h5>nirguna rūpa sulabha ati saguna jāna nahiṃ kōi.</h5> <h5>sugama agama nānā carita suni muni mana bhrama hōi..73kha.. [7-73(B)]</h5> <p>Steeped in lust, anger, arrogance and greed and attached to their home, which is a picture of woe, how can such dullards know the Lord of the Raghus, fallen as they are in the depths of darkness (ignorance)? The attributeless aspect of the Godhead is easy to understand; but no one can comprehend the embodied form (which is beyond all modes of Prakṛti and divine in character). Even a sage&rsquo;s soul is bewildered on hearing of the various exploits of the Lord, both of an intelligible and baffling character.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-6 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/11" > <span>Previous (Part - 11)</span> </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/13" > <span>Next (Part - 13)</span> </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Scriptures/Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (Tulsi Ramayana)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>7 - Uttar Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/12"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part - 12</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img loading=lazy  src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png" > </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-title> Select language </swal-title> <swal-input type=select  value=hi  /> <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/language-selector.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
