[7-73(B)-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Hear, O lord of the feathered kingdom, of the greatness of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). I recite to you according to the best of my lights a delightful story in this connection. I shall also narrate to you the whole story as to how I fell a prey to delusion, my lord. You, dear Garuḍa, are a favourite of Śrī Rāma and fond of hearing Śrī Hari&rsquo;s praises and a source of delight to me. I am, therefore, concealing nothing from you and tell you a profound and charming secret. Hear of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s innate disposition: He never tolerates pride in His people. For pride is the root of metempsychosis and the cause of all kinds of pain and every form of grief. Hence the All-merciful gets rid of it in His extreme fondness for His servants, even as when a boil appears on the body of a child, my lord, the mother gets it opened like one having a stony heart.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jadapi prathama dukha pāvai rōvai bāla adhīra.</h5> <h5>byādhi nāsa hita jananī ganati na sō sisu pīra..74ka.. [7-74(A)]</h5> <h5>timi raghupati nija dāsakara harahiṃ māna hita lāgi.</h5> <h5>tulasidāsa aisē prabhuhi kasa na bhajahu bhrama tyāgi..74kha.. [7-74(B)]</h5> <p>Although at first (while the boil is being cut open) the child experiences pain and cries helplessly the mother minds not the child&rsquo;s agony, in her anxiety to see the child cured. Even so, in the interest of the devotee himself, the Lord of the Raghus takes away his pride. Forswearing all error, Tulasīdāsa, why should you not adore such a lord as this?</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>rāma kṛpā āpani jaḍatāī. kahau khagēsa sunahu mana lāī..</h5> <h5>jaba jaba rāma manuja tanu dharahīṃ. bhakta hētu līla bahu karahīṃ..

[7-74(B)-4]</h5> <p>Now, O lord of the feathered kingdom, I tell you of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s benignity and my own opacity; listen attentively. Whenever Śrī Rāma appears in human semblance and enacts numberless sports for the sake of His devotees I betake myself to the city of Ayodhyā and delight to watch His childish exploits. I go and witness the grand festival of His birth and, fascinated (by the charm of His childish sports), stay on there for full five years. The child Rāma is my beloved deity, who sums up in His person the charm of countless Cupids. Ever gazing on the countenance of my lord, I allow my eyes to enjoy the fruit of their existence, O enemy of serpents. Assuming the form of a small crow and remaining in the company of Śrī Hari I witness His childish exploits of all kinds.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>larikāīṃ jahaom jahaom phirahiṃ tahaom tahaom saṃga uḍaāu.</h5> <h5>jūṭhani parai ajira mahaom sō uṭhāi kari khāu..75ka..

[7-75(B)]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Wherever He moves about as a child I flutter about close to Him. And the crumbs that fall from His mouth in the courtyard I pick up and eat. In one particular cycle the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line performed all His exploits in an extreme degree.&rdquo; The moment Kākabhuśuṇḍi recalled those exploits every hair on his body stood erect.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kahai bhasuṃḍa sunahu khaganāyaka. rāmacarita sēvaka sukhadāyaka..</h5> <h5>nṛpamaṃdira suṃdara saba bhāomtī. khacita kanaka mani nānā jātī..

[7-75(B)-4]</h5> <p>Continued Bhuśuṇḍi : &ldquo;Listen, O chief of the birds; the story of Śrī Rāma is the delight of His servants. The king&rsquo;s palace (at Ayodhyā) was beautiful in everyway; it was all of gold studded with precious stones of various kinds. The courtyard, where the four brothers played everyday, was magnificent beyond description. The Lord of the Raghus frolicked about in this yard carrying on childish pastimes that were the delight of His mother. His tender frame was dark of hue with a greenish tinge resembling that of the emerald; every limb of it had the loveliness of numberless Cupids compressed into it. His feet were soft and ruddy like a young lotus, with bright toes and nails that outshone the brilliance of the moon. They had soles bearing the fourfold lovely marks of the thunderbolt, the elephant-goad, the flag and the lotus, and were adorned with beautiful anklets that sweetly jingled. The charming zone about His waist, which was made of gold bossed with jewels produced a pleasant tinkling sound.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>rēkhā traya sundara udara nābhī rucira gaombhīra.</h5> <h5>ura āyata bhrājata bibidha bāla bibhūṣana cīra..76.. [7-76]</h5> <p>The belly contained three lovely folds with a charming deep navel. The broad chest gleamed with jewels and raiment of various kinds, all befitting a child.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>aruna pāni nakha karaja manōhara. bāhu bisāla bibhūṣana suṃdara..</h5> <h5>kaṃdha bāla kēhari dara grīvā. cāru cibuka ānana chabi sīṃvā..

[7-76-5]</h5> <p>His roseate hands, nails and fingers were all captivating; His long arms were richly adorned. He had shoulders resembling those of a lion&rsquo;s cub and a neck shaped like a conch, a lovely chin and a face which was the very perfection of beauty. His speech was yet indistinct, His lips rosy and His mouth contained a pair of small pearly and shapely teeth both above and below. He had lovely cheeks, a charming nose and a smile which afforded delight and was bright as the rays of the moon. His eyes, which resembled a pair of blue lotuses, undid the bonds of worldly existence; while His forehead gleamed with a sacred mark made with yellow pigment. He had arched eyebrows, pretty well-matched ears and curly darkblue hair that scattered their charm all round. A thin yellow garment set off His swarthy person, and His shrill gleeful cry and glance captivated me. Thus frolicking in the courtyard of the royal palace, the All-beautiful danced at the sight of His own shadow and played with me in diverse ways, which I blush to tell you. Crying with joy as He ran to catch hold of me, I flew away; then He showed me a piece of sweet cake.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>āvata nikaṭa haomsahiṃ prabhu bhājata rudana karāhiṃ.</h5> <h5>jāu samīpa gahana pada phiri phiri citai parāhiṃ..77ka.. [7-77(A)]</h5> <h5>prākṛta sisu iva līlā dēkhi bhayau mōhi mōha.</h5> <h5>kavana caritra karata prabhu cidānaṃda saṃdōha..77kha.. [7-77(B)]</h5> <p>As I went near Him the lord smiled; but the moment I flew away He fell acrying. And when I approached Him to lay hold of His feet He scampered off, turning round again and again to look at me. Seeing Him play like an ordinary child I was overcome by bewilderment : &ldquo;What ! are these actions in anyway worthy of Him who is knowledge and bliss personified?&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>ētanā mana ānata khagarāyā. raghupati prērita byāpī māyā..</h5> <h5>sō māyā na dukhada mōhi kāhīṃ. āna jīva iva saṃsṛta nāhīṃ.. [7-77(B)-1]</h5> <h5>nātha ihāom kachu kārana ānā. sunahu sō sāvadhāna harijānā..</h5> <h5>gyāna akhaṃḍa ēka sītābara. māyā basya jīva sacarācara.. [7-77(B)-2]</h5> <h5>jauṃ saba kēṃ raha gyāna ēkarasa. īsvara jīvahi bhēda kahahu kasa..</h5> <h5>māyā basya jīva abhimānī. īsa basya māyā gunakhānī.. [7-77(B)-3]</h5> <h5>parabasa jīva svabasa bhagavaṃtā. jīva anēka ēka śrīkaṃtā..</h5> <h5>mudhā bhēda jadyapi kṛta māyā. binu hari jāi na kōṭi upāyā.. [7-77(B)-4]</h5> <p>The moment I allowed this doubt to enter my mind, O king of the birds, Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s Māyā (delusive power) took possession of me as directed by the Lord of the Raghus. That Māyā, however, did not prove to be a source of trouble to me, nor did it throw me into the whirlpool of birth and death as it does in the case of other creatures. This, my lord, was attributable to some extraordinary reason. Hear it attentively, O mount of Śrī Hari, Sītā&rsquo;s Spouse alone is absolute intelligence; every creature, whether animate or inanimate, is subject to Māyā. If all had the same perfect wisdom, tell me, what would be the difference between God and the Jīva (the individual soul)? The latter, which identifies itself with a particular psycho-physical organism, is subject to Māyā; while Māyā itself, the source of the three Guṇas, is controlled by God. The Jīva is dependent (subject to Māyā), while God is self-dependent. The Jivas are many, while the Beloved of Lakṣmī is one (without a second). Even though this difference, which has been created by Māyā, is false, it cannot disappear except by Śrī Hari&rsquo;s grace, whatever you may do.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>rāmacaṃdra kē bhajana binu jō caha pada nirbāna.</h5> <h5>gyānavaṃta api sō nara pasu binu pūomcha biṣāna..78ka.. [7-78(A)]</h5> <h5>rākāpati ṣōḍasa uahiṃ tārāgana samudāi..</h5> <h5>sakala girinha dava lāia binu rabi rāti na jāi..78kha.. [7-78(B)]</h5> <p>The man who seeks to attain the state of eternal bliss without adoring Śrī Rāmacandra is a beast without tail and horns, however wise he may be. Even though the moon rose complete in all her sixteen digits with the entire starry host, and even if all the mountains were set on fire, night would not yield except to the sun.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>aisēhiṃ hari binu bhajana khagēsā. miṭai na jīvanha kēra kalēsā..</h5> <h5>hari sēvakahi na byāpa abidyā. prabhu prērita byāpai tēhi bidyā.. [7-78(B)-1]</h5> <h5>tātē nāsa na hōi dāsa kara. bhēda bhagati bhāḍhai bihaṃgabara..</h5> <h5>bhrama tē cakita rāma mōhi dēkhā. bihaomsē sō sunu carita bisēṣā.. [7-78(B)-2]</h5> <h5>tēhi kautuka kara maramu na kāhūom. jānā anuja na mātu pitāhūom..</h5> <h5>jānu pāni dhāē mōhi dharanā. syāmala gāta aruna kara caranā..

[7-78(B)-4]</h5> <p>In like manner, O lord of the feathered race mortals cannot be rid of their suffering without adoring Śrī Hari. Avidyā (Nescience) has no power over a servant of Śrī Hari; it is Vidyā (knowledge of Brahma in Its relative aspect) that holds away over him as directed by the Lord. That is why a servant of the Lord never falls; on the other hand, O best of birds, his devotion to the Lord as apart from himself grows. Śrī Rāma smiled to see me bewildered with error : now hear further particulars in this connection. The secret of this diversion nobody came to know, neither His younger brothers nor His parents. The Lord with a swarthy form and rosy hands and feet crawled on His hands and knees in order to catch me. Thereupon, O enemy of serpents, I took to flight. Śrī Rāma stretched out His arm to lay hold on me. Away as I flew into the air I saw Śrī Hari&rsquo;s arm close to me everywhere.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>brahmalōka lagi gayau maiṃ citayau pācha uḍaāta.</h5> <h5>juga aṃgula kara bīca saba rāma bhujahi mōhi tāta..79ka.. [7-79(A)]</h5> <h5>saptābarana bhēda kari jahāom lagēṃ gati mōri.</h5> <h5>gayau tahāom prabhu bhuja nirakhi byākula bhayau bahōri..79kha.. [7-79(B)]</h5> <p>I flew up to Brahmā&rsquo;s abode; but when I looked back in my flight, two fingers&rsquo; breadth, dear Garuḍa, was all the distance between Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s arm and myself. Penetrating the seven folds of the universe (consisting of earth, water, fire, air, ether, the cosmic ego and the cosmic intellect) I mounted to the utmost height I could reach. But there too I saw the Lord&rsquo;s arm; then I felt alarmed.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>mūdēu nayana trasita jaba bhayau. puni citavata kōsalapura gayaūom..</h5> <h5>mōhi bilōki rāma musukāhīṃ. bihaomsata turata gayau mukha māhīṃ..

[7-79(B)-4]</h5> <p>In my terror I closed my eyes; and when I opened them again I found myself at Kosalapura (Ayodhyā). Śrī Rāma smiled to see me back; and even as He laughed I was instantly driven into His mouth (throat). Listen, king of the birds: inside His belly I beheld multitudinous universes with many strange spheres each more wonderful than the rest, with myriads of Brahmās and Śivas, countless stars, suns and moons, numberless Lokapālas (guardians of spheres), Yamas (gods of punishment) and Kālas (gods of death), innumerable mountains and vast terrestrial globes, oceans, rivers, lakes and forests without end and manifold other varieties of creation, with gods and sages, the Siddhas, Nāgas, human beings and Kiṁnaras and the four classes of living beings, both moving and motionless.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jō nahiṃ dēkhā nahiṃ sunā jō manahūom na samāi.</h5> <h5>sō saba adbhuta dēkhēu barani kavani bidhi jāi..80ka..

[7-80(B)]</h5> <p>I saw there all such marvels as I had never seen or heard of before and such as could not be conceived even by the mind; how, then, can I describe them? I stayed a full hundred year in each of those universes and in this manner I went round and beheld multitudinous universes having the shape of an egg.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>lōka lōka prati bhinna bidhātā. bhinna biṣnu siva manu disitrātā..</h5> <h5>nara gaṃdharba bhūta bētālā. kiṃnara nisicara pasu khaga byālā..

[7-80(B)-4]</h5> <p>Each universe had its own Brahmā (Creator), its own Viṣṇu (Preserver), Śiva (Destroyer), Manu (lord of creation presiding over a single Manvantara, consisting of a little more than 74 rounds of the four Yugas), regents of the quarters, human beings, Gandharvas (celestial musicians), spectres and goblins, Kiṁnaras (another class of heavenly musicians having a human figure with the head of a horse), Rākṣasas (giants), quadrupeds, birds, serpents, gods and demons of all classes, all the creatures having a shape peculiar to that universe. The earth with its multitudinous rivers, oceans, lakes and mountains, nay, the entire creation in each universe had a distinctive character. In all these universes I found myself possessed of manifold incomparable forms. Each universe had its own Ayodhyā with its own Sarayμu and its own men and women. And listen, dear Garuḍa : Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s parents-Daśaratha and Kausalyā-as well as Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s brothers, Bharata and others, were all different in each universe. In each such universe I witnessed the descent of Śrī Rāma as well as the infinite variety of His childish sports.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhinna bhinna mai dīkha sabu ati bicitra harijāna.</h5> <h5>aganita bhuvana phirēu prabhu rāma na dēkhēu āna..81ka..

But in my round of the innumerable universes I saw no other Rāma, my lord. Tossed by the blast of infatuation I saw, in each successive world that I visited, the same child-like ways, the same beauty, the same gracious Rāma (Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line).</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhramata mōhi brahmāṃḍa anēkā. bītē manahu kalpa sata ēkā..</h5> <h5>phirata phirata nija āśrama āyau. tahaom puni rahi kachu kāla gavāomyau..

Meanwhile as I happened to hear of my lord&rsquo;s birth at Ayodhyā I started up and ran in an overwhelming ecstasy of love and went and witnessed the grand festival of His birth as I have already told you at length. (It need hardly be said that all this happened inside the belly of my lord.) Thus in the belly of Śrī Rāma I beheld a number of universes. But what I saw could only be seen with one&rsquo;s eyes: it was beyond all telling. There again I beheld the divine Śrī Rāma, the gracious and all-wise Lord of Māyā. I pondered again and again. But my understanding was obscured by the mists of delusion. In less than an hour I had seen everything. My soul being utterly bewildered, I was lost in a maze.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>dēkhi kṛpāla bikala mōhi bihaomsē taba raghubīra.</h5> <h5>bihaomsatahīṃ mukha bāhēra āyau sunu matidhīra..82ka..

No other word came to my mouth. When the Lord saw me overpowered with love, He immediately checked the power of His Māyā. The Lord, who is so merciful to the afflicted, placed His lotus hand on my head and relieved me of all sorrow. The gracious Śrī Rāma, the delight of His servants, rid me of my deep-rooted error. As I reflected on His former glory my mind was flooded with joy. Seeing the Lord&rsquo;s loving kindness to His devotees my heart began to throb with profuse love. With eyes full of tears and joined palms and every hair on my body standing erect, I then made supplication to Him in many ways.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>suni saprēma mama bānī dēkhi dīna nija dāsa.</h5> <h5>bacana sukhada gaṃbhīra mṛdu bōlē ramānivāsa..83ka..

Without such devotion all sorts of virtues and blessings are like so many auxiliary dishes without salt. Of what avail is any blessing without adoration.&rdquo; Pondering thus, O king of the birds, I replied as follows : &ldquo;If it is Your pleasure, my lord, to grant me a boon and if You are kind and affectionate to me, I ask my cherished boon, O master; for You are generous and know the secrets of all hearts.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>abirala bhagati bisudhda tava śruti purāna jō gāva.</h5> <h5>jēhi khōjata jōgīsa muni prabhu prasāda kōu pāva..84ka..

Again and again I repeat to you the truth that no one is so dear to Me as My devotee. If Virañci (the Creator) too had no devotion to Me, he would be only as dear to Me as all the other creatures.

The eyes alone had the blissful experience of beholding the Lord&rsquo;s beauty; but how could they describe it, devoid of speech as they are? After He had gladdened me by His manifold exhortations in this way He again began to sport like a child as before. With tears in His eyes and His looks somewhat gloomy He looked at His mother (Kausalyā) as if He were hungry. Seeing this the mother started up in haste and ran; and addressing Him in soft words clasped Him to her bosom. Then, laying Him in her lap she began to suckle Him, singing the while of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s charming exploits.</p> <h4>Sortas</h4> <h5>jēhi sukha lāgi purāri asubha bēṣa kṛta siva sukhada.</h5> <h5>avadhapurī nara nāri tēhi sukha mahu saṃtata magana..88ka..

The sages sing Śrī Hari&rsquo;s praises each according to his wits; but neither the Vedas nor Śeṣa (the serpent-god) nor the blessed Śiva Himself can reach their end. All winged creatures, from yourself down to the mosquito, take their flight across the sky; but none can reach the end of it. Even so, dear Garuḍa, can anyone ever gauge the exent of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s greatness, unfathomable as it is ? Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s body possesses the charm of a myriad Cupids.

He is as sharp as countless millions of Śāradās and possesses the creative skill of a myriad Brahmās. Again, He is as good a preserver as a myriad Visnus and as thorough a destroyer as a myriad Rudras. He is as rich as a myriad Kuberas and as capable of bringing forth material universes as a myriad Mayas. He is as good a supporter (of the universes) as a myriad Śeṣas. In short, Lord Śrī Rāma, the sovereign of the universe, is infinite and incomparable ( in every respect).</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>nirupama na upamā āna rāma samāna rāmu nigama kahai.</h5> <h5>jimi kōṭi sata khadyōta sama rabi kahata ati laghutā lahai..</h5> <h5>ēhi bhāomti nija nija mati bilāsa munisa harihi bakhānahīṃ.</h5> <h5>prabhu bhāva gāhaka ati kṛpāla saprēma suni sukha mānahīṃ..</h5> <p>Incomparable as He is, He has no compeer. Śrī Rāma alone is Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s peer- so declare the Vedas-even as the sun really suffers diminution by being likened to a myriad glow-worms. So do the great sages sing the praises of Śrī Hari each according to the flight of his own wits and the Lord lovingly hears them and feels delighted (however inadequate the praise may be); for He respects the sentiment of His devotees and is extremely kind.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>rāmu amita guna sāgara thāha ki pāvai kōi.</h5> <h5>saṃtanha sana jasa kichu sunēu tumhahi sunāyau sōi..92ka..

Tears rushed to his eyes and his soul was flooded with joy as he meditated on the glory of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). Recalling his former delusion he was filled with remorse at the thought that He had taken the dateless Brahma for a mere mortal. Again and again he bowed his head at the crow&rsquo;s feet and loved him all the more, knowing him to be as good as Rāma. Without a spiritual guide none can cross the ocean of mundane existence, though he be the equal of Virañci (the Creator) or Lord Śaṅkara. He said, &ldquo;I was bitten by the serpent of doubt, dear Sir. (As an effect of this snake-bite) I had several painful fits of stupor in the form of so many fallacies. But the Lord of the Raghus, the delight of His devotees, has saved me by sending me to a charmer in your person. By your grace my infatuation has ceased and I have learnt the incomparable mystery of Śrī Rāma.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>tāhi prasaṃsi bibidha bidhi sīsa nāi kara jōri.</h5> <h5>bacana binīta saprēma mṛdu bōlēu garuḍa bahōri..93ka..

My lord, I have heard it from Śiva Himself that you do not perish even during Mahapralaya (the Great Dissolution when Brahma himself retires into the Lord&rsquo;s body after completing the 100 years of his existence). The divine Lord Śiva would never utter an idle word and therefore my mind is in doubt. My lord, the whole universe with all its animate and inanimate beings, including the Nāgas, human beings and gods, is an intended victim of Death.

[7-94(B)-4]</h5> <p>Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) the crow (Kākabhuśuṇḍi) rejoiced to hear Garuḍa&rsquo;s words and replied with utmost affection : &ldquo;Blessed, blessed indeed is your intellect, O enemy of serpents. Your question is very pleasing to me. On hearing your loving and agreeable question I have been reminded of many previous births. I shall now narrate the whole of my story at full length; dear Garuḍa, listen to it attentively with all reverence. The muttering of prayers, austere penance, performing sacrifices, subjugation of the mind and the senses, undertaking sacred vows, charity, dispassion, right judgment, Yoga (union with God) and Realization-the fruit of all these is devotion to the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus); without this no one can attain lasting peace. It was in this body that I was blessed with devotion to Śrī Rāma; hence it is so very dear to me. Everyone naturally loves that through which one has attained one&rsquo;s object.</p> <h4>Sortas</h4> <h5>pannagāri asi nīti śruti saṃmata sajjana kahahiṃ.</h5> <h5>ati nīcahu sana prīti karia jāni nija parama hita..95ka..

[7-94(B)-95(B)]</h5> <p>It is a sound maxim, O enemy of serpents, approved of by the Vedas-and the saints too endorse it-that love should be shown to the meanest creature if we come to know it to be our greatest friend. Silk, for instance, is the product of a worm and from it we have beautiful silken textiles. That is why everyone tends the worm like one&rsquo;s own life even though it is most impure.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>svāratha sāomca jīva kahu ēhā. mana krama bacana rāma pada nēhā..</h5> <h5>sōi pāvana sōi subhaga sarīrā. jō tanu pāi bhajia raghubīrā..

[7-94(B)-5]</h5> <p>The real self-interest of every living creature lies in cultivating devotion to Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet in thought, word and deed. That body alone is sacred and that alone blessed, in which one is able to worship the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line. The wise and the learned never extol him who is hostile to Śrī Rāma, even though he may acquire a body as exalted as that of Brahmā (the Creator) himself, Devotion to Śrī Rāma took root in my heart in this very body; hence I hold it supremely dear, my master. Although my death depends on my own will, I refuse to quit this body, because-as the Vedas declare- adoration of the Lord is not possible without a corporeal frame. At first infatuation gave me much trouble; so long as I remained hostile to Śrī Rāma I never had a restful sleep. Through a number births I practised Yoga (concentration of mind), Japa (muttering of prayers), austere penance and charity and performed sacrifices and other acts of various kinds. Which species is there in this world, O lord of the winged creatures, in which I have not at sometime been born during my round of births? I have had experience of all kinds of pursuits, my lord; but I was never so happy as I am now. I recollect many previous existences, my lord, in which by Śiva grace my understanding was not clouded by infatuation.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>prathama janma kē carita aba kahau sunahu bihagēsa.</h5> <h5>suni prabhu pada rati upajai jātēṃ miṭahiṃ kalēsa..96ka..

[7-96(B)]</h5> <p>Listen, O lord of the feathered kingdom: I now proceed to narrate the story of my very first birth (within my memory), which is sure to engender in the heart of the listener love for the Lord&rsquo;s feet, which is the remedy for all afflictions. In a former Kalpa (round of creation), my lord, the world was passing through a Kaliyuga, the hotbed of sin, in which men and women were all steeped in unrighteousness and acted contrary to the Vedas.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>tēhi kalijuga kōsalapura jāī. janmata bhayau sūdra tanu pāī..</h5> <h5>siva sēvaka mana krama aru bānī. āna dēva niṃdaka abhimānī..

[7-96(B)-4]</h5> <p>In that Kaliyuga I was born in the city of Ayodhyā and got the body of a Sμudra (a member of the labouring and artisan classes). A devotee of Lord Śiva in thought, word and deed, I was a reviler of other gods and conceited too. Intoxicated with the pride of pelf, I was most loquacious and savage of purpose and carried an enormous load of hypocrisy in my heart. Even though I dwelt in the capital of Śrī Rāma (the lord of the Raghus), I failed to know even an iota of its glory then. Now I have come to know the greatness of Ayodhyā. Thus has it been sung by the Vedas, Tantras and Purāṇas that whoever has resided in Ayodhyā in any birth whatsoever surely becomes a votary of Śrī Rāma. A man comes to know the glory of Ayodhyā only when Śrī Rāma, bow in hand, takes up His abode in his heart. That particular age of Kali was terrible indeed, O enemy of serpents; every man and woman was given over to sin.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kalimala grasē dharma saba lupta bhaē sadagraṃtha.</h5> <h5>daṃbhinha nija mati kalpi kari pragaṭa kiē bahu paṃtha..97ka..

The people had all fallen a prey to delusion and all pious acts had been swallowed by greed. Now listen, all-wise mount of Śrī Hari, while I describe a few peculiarities of Kali.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>barana dharma nahiṃ āśrama cārī. śruti birōdha rata saba nara nārī..</h5> <h5>dvija śruti bēcaka bhūpa prajāsana. kōu nahiṃ māna nigama anusāsana..

[7-97(B)-4]</h5> <p>No one follows the duties of one&rsquo;s own caste, and the four Āśramas or stages of life also disappear. Every man and woman takes delight in revolting against the Vedas. The Brāhmaṇas sell the Vedas; the kings bleed their subjects; no one respects the injunction of the Vedas. The right course for every individual is that which one takes a fancy to; a man of erudition is he who plays the braggart. Whoever launches spurious undertakings and is given over to hypocrisy, him does everyone call a saint. He alone is clever, who robs another of his wealth; he who puts up false appearances is an ardent follower of established usage. He who is given to lying and is clever at joking is spoken of as a man of parts in the Kali age. He alone who is a reprobate and has abandoned the path of the Vedas is a man of wisdom and dispassion in the Kali age. He alone who has grown big nails and long locks of matted hair is a renowned ascetic in the Kali age.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>asubha bēṣa bhūṣana dharēṃ bhacchābhaccha jē khāhiṃ.</h5> <h5>tēi jōgī tēi siddha nara pūjya tē kalijuga māhiṃ..98ka..

[7-98(A)-4]</h5> <p>Dominated by women, my lord, all men dance to their tune like a monkey controlled by its trainer. Śūdras instruct the twice-born in spiritual wisdom and, wearing the sacred thread, accept the worst type of gifts. All men are given over to sensuality and greed and irascible too, and are hostile to the gods; the Brāhmaṇas, the Vedas as well as to the saints. Unfortunate wives desert their accomplished and handsome husband and bestow their heart on a paramour. Wives having their husband alive have no ornament on their person, while widows adorn themselves in the latest style. The disciple and the preceptor severally resemble a deaf man and a blind man : the one would not listen, while the other cannot see. A spiritual guide who robs his disciple of money but fails to rid him of his sorrow is cast into a terrible hell. Parents call their children and teach them such religion as may fill their belly.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>brahma gyāna binu nāri nara kahahiṃ na dūsari bāta.</h5> <h5>kauḍaī lāgi lōbha basa karahiṃ bipra gura ghāta..99ka..

Śūdras argue with the twice-born : &ldquo;Are we in anyway inferior to you? A good Brāhmaṇa is he who knows the truth of Brahma !&rdquo; and defiantly glower at them.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>para triya laṃpaṭa kapaṭa sayānē. mōha drōha mamatā lapaṭānē..</h5> <h5>tēi abhēdabādī gyānī nara. dēkhā mēṃ caritra kalijuga kara..

Such is the practice I have seen in every Kali age. Doomed themselves, such people bring ruin even to those rare souls who tread the path of virtue. They who find fault with the Vedas by dint of logic are condemned to each hell for a whole Kalpa (cycle). People of the lowest grade in society such as oil-men, potters, the outcaste (lit., those who cook and feed on the flesh of a dog), the Kirātas and Kolas and the distillers of spirituous liquors get their heads shaved and enter the order of Samnyasa (renunciation) when their wife is no more in this world and they have lost their household property. They allow themselves to be worshipped by the Brāhmaṇas and bring ruin to themselves here as well as hereafter. As for the Brāhmaṇas, they are unlettered, grasping, lascivious, reprobate and stupid and marry low-caste women of a lewd character. Śūdras, on the other hand, practise Japa (the muttering of prayers) and austere penance, undertake sacred vows of various kinds and expound the Purāṇas from an exalted seat. All men follow a course of conduct of their own imagination; the endless variety of wrongdoing cannot be described in words.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhaē barana saṃkara kali bhinnasētu saba lōga.</h5> <h5>karahiṃ pāpa pāvahiṃ dukha bhaya ruja sōka biyōga..100ka..

[7-100(B)]</h5> <p>In the age of Kali there ensues a confusion of castes (due to promiscuous intermarriages) and everyone infringes the sacred laws. Men perpetrate sins and reap suffering terror, disease, sorrow and desolation. Overcome by delusion they walk not in the path of Devotion to Śrī Hari, conjoined with dispassion and wisdom-a path which has the approval of the Vedas-and invent diverse creeds of their own.</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>bahu dāma saomvārahiṃ dhāma jatī. biṣayā hari līnhi na rahi biratī..</h5> <h5>tapasī dhanavaṃta daridra gṛhī. kali kautuka tāta na jāta kahī..</h5> <h5>kulavaṃti nikārahiṃ nāri satī. gṛha ānihiṃ cērī nibēri gatī..</h5> <h5>suta mānahiṃ mātu pitā taba lauṃ. abalānana dīkha nahīṃ jaba lauṃ..</h5> <h5>sasurāri piāri lagī jaba tēṃ. riparūpa kuṭuṃba bhaē taba tēṃ..</h5> <h5>nṛpa pāpa parāyana dharma nahīṃ. kari daṃḍa biḍaṃba prajā nitahīṃ..</h5> <h5>dhanavaṃta kulīna malīna apī. dvija cinha janēu ughāra tapī..</h5> <h5>nahiṃ māna purāna na bēdahi jō. hari sēvaka saṃta sahī kali sō..</h5> <h5>kabi bṛṃda udāra dunī na sunī. guna dūṣaka brāta na kōpi gunī..</h5> <h5>kali bārahiṃ bāra dukāla parai. binu anna dukhī saba lōga marai..</h5> <p>The so-called recluses build themselves houses and furnish them at considerable expense; dispassion is no more to be seen in them, the same having been wiped out by their sensuality. The so-called ascetics grow wealthy and householders go penniless: the freaks of the Kali age, dear Garuḍa, are beyond all telling. Men drive out a well-born and virtuous wife and bring home some servant-girl, casting to the winds all good usage. Sons respect their father and mother only so long as they have not seen the face of their wife. From the time they take a fancy to their wife&rsquo;s kinsfolk they begin to look upon their own people as their enemies. Kings get addicted to sin and cease to have anything to do with piety. They ever persecute their subjects by inflicting unmerited punishment on them. The meanest churl, if he is rich, is accounted noble. A Brāhmaṇa is known only by his sacred thread, and an ascetic by his naked body. He who refuses to recognize the Vedas and Purāṇas is a true saint and servant of Śrī Hari in the Kali age. Poets are seen in large numbers; but the munificent (who reward them) are seldom heard of. Those who find fault with others&rsquo; virtues can be had in any number, but no one possessing virtues. In the Kali age famines are of frequent occurrence: for want of foodgrains people perish miserably en masse.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sunu khagēsa kali kapaṭa haṭha daṃbha dvēṣa pāṣaṃḍa.</h5> <h5>māna mōha mārādi mada byāpi rahē brahmaṃḍa..101ka..

[7-101(B)-5]</h5> <p>Women have no ornament except their tresses and have an enormous appetite. Though miserable for want of money, they are rich in attachment of various kinds. Though hankering after happiness they love not piety, stupid as they are. Though they are poor in wits, their mind is hardened and knows no tenderness. As for men, they are tormented with diseases and find no enjoyment anywhere. They are conceited and contend with others without any rhyme or reason. Men&rsquo;s life is short, extending to not more than five or ten years; yet in their pride they reckon on surviving the end of creation. The age of Kali has driven men mad: no one respects the sanctity even of one&rsquo;s sister or daughter. There is no contentment, nor discernment, nor composure. People of all classes, whether high or low, have taken to begging. Envy, harsh words and covetousness are rampant; while evenness of mind is absent. People are all smitten with bereavement and deep sorrow. The duties and rules of conduct prescribed for the four orders of society and stages in life are neglected. Self-control, charity, compassion and wisdom disappear; while stupidity and fraud multiply to a large extent. Men and women all pamper their body; while slanderers are diffused all over the world.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sunu byālāri kāla kali mala avaguna āgāra.</h5> <h5>gunau bahuta kalijuga kara binu prayāsa nistāra..102ka.. [7-102(A)]</h5> <h5>kṛtajuga trētā dvāpara pūjā makha aru jōga.</h5> <h5>jō gati hōi sō kali hari nāma tē pāvahiṃ lōga..102kha.. [7-102(B)]</h5> <p>Listen, O enemy of serpents: the age of Kali is a storehouse of impurities and vices. But it has many virtues too; final emancipation is possible (in this age) without any exertion. Moreover, the same goal which is reached through worship of God, performance of sacrifices or practice of Yoga in the Satyayuga, Tretā and Dvāpara, men are able to attain through the name of Śrī Hari in the Kali age.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kṛtajuga saba jōgī bigyānī. kari hari dhyāna tarahiṃ bhava prānī..</h5> <h5>trētāom bibidha jagya nara karahīṃ. prabhuhi samarpi karma bhava tarahīṃ..

[7-102(B)-4]</h5> <p>In the Satyayuga everyone is possessed of mystic powers and wise too. Hence in that age men cross the ocean of mundane existence by meditating on Śrī Hari. In the Tretā age men perform sacrifices of various kinds and cross the ocean of metempsychosis by dedicating their actions to the Lord. In the Dvāpara age men cross the ocean of worldly existence by adoring the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus), there being no other means to do it. In the Kali age, however, men reach the end of mundane existence simply by singing Śrī Hari&rsquo;s praises. In the age of Kali neither Yoga (concentration of mind), nor the performance of sacrifices nor spiritual wisdom is of any avail; one&rsquo;s only hope lies in hymning Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s praises. Giving up all other hopes, whosoever worships Śrī Rāma and fondly chants His praises undoubtedly crosses the ocean of transmigration. The power of the Name is thus manifest in the age of Kali. The Kali age possesses another sacred virtue: in this age projected acts of virtue are rewarded, but projected sins are not punished.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kalijuga sama juga āna nahiṃ jauṃ nara kara bisvāsa.</h5> <h5>gāi rāma guna gana bimalaom bhava tara binahiṃ prayāsa..103ka..

[7-103(B)]</h5> <p>No other age can compare with the Kali age provided a man has faith (in its virtue); for in this age one can easily cross the ocean of transmigration simply by singing Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s holy praises. Piety has four well-known pillars, of which one is predominant in the Kali: charity practised in any way conduces to one&rsquo;s spiritual good.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>nita juga dharma hōhiṃ saba kērē. hṛdayaom rāma māyā kē prērē..</h5> <h5>suddha satva samatā bigyānā. kṛta prabhāva prasanna mana jānā..

[7-103(B)-4]</h5> <p>Prompted by Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s delusive potency, the characteristics of all the four Yugas manifest themselves in everyone&rsquo;s heart everyday. The presence of pure Sattva (harmony), evenness of mind, spiritual insight and the feeling of vivacity in the heart are the effects of Satyayuga. Abundance of Sattva with a slight admixture of Rajas, attachment to action, and happiness of every kind are the characteristics of Tretā. Much Rajas, little Sattva, and some Tamas, with a feeling of mingled joy and terror in the heart, are the distinguishing features of Dvāpara. A large proportion of Tamas with a slight admixture of Rajas and antagonism everywhere are the effects of Kali. The wise discern the characteristics of the different Yugas in their mind and forswearing unrighteousness devote themselves to piety. The characteristics of the Time-Spirit have no effect on him who is excessively fond of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet. The deception practised by a juggler, O king of the birds, is formidable indeed: but the tricks of a juggler cannot deceive his servant.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>hari māyā kṛta dōṣa guna binu hari bhajana na jāhiṃ.</h5> <h5>bhajia rāma taji kāma saba asa bicāri mana māhiṃ..104ka..

[7-104(B)]</h5> <p>The good and evil, which are the creation of Śrī Hari&rsquo;s delusive potency, cannot be eliminated except through worship of Śrī Hari. Bearing this in mind, and forswearing all desire, one should adore Śrī Hari. In that particular age of Kali, O lord of the winged creatures, I lived in Ayodhyā for many years till a famine occurred, when, stricken by adversity, I had to move to another place.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>gayau ujēnī sunu uragārī. dīna malīna daridra dukhārī..</h5> <h5>gaēom kāla kachu saṃpati pāī. tahaom puni karau saṃbhu sēvakāī..

[7-104(B)-4]</h5> <p>Listen, O enemy of serpents : I went to Ujjain-miserable, downcast, penniless and afflicted. When sometime had elapsed, I acquired some wealth and after that I began worshipping Lord Śambhu at that very place. There was a Brāhmaṇa there who constantly worshipped Lord Śiva according to the Vedic rites and had no other occupation. He was an extremely pious soul and a knower of the highest truth, a votary of Lord Śambhu but no reviler of Śrī Hari. I served him though with a guileful heart. The Brāhmaṇa was very kind-hearted and an abode of piety. Seeing me outwardly so humble, my Lord, the Brāhmaṇa taught me as his own son. The great Brāhmaṇa imparted to me a mystic formula sacred to Lord Śambhu and gave me every kind of good advice. I used to go to a temple of Lord Śiva and repeat the formula there with unbounded ostentation and conceit in my heart.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>maiṃ khala mala saṃkula mati nīca jāti basa mōha.</h5> <h5>hari jana dvija dēkhēṃ jarau karau biṣnu kara drōha..105ka..

[7-105(A)-105(B)]</h5> <p>A wretch impure of mind, low-born and overcome by infatuation, I was filled with jealousy at the very sight of a servant of Śrī Hari or a Brāhmaṇa and hated God Viṣṇu Distressed to see my conduct, my preceptor would admonish me everyday; but on hearing his admonition I burnt with rage. Can sober counsel appeal to a hypocrite?</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-5 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/12" > <span>Previous (Part - 12)</span> </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/14" > <span>Next (Part - 14)</span> </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (Tulsi Ramayana)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>7 - Uttar Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/13"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part - 13</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-title> Select language </swal-title> <swal-input type=select  value=hi  /> <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/language-selector.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
