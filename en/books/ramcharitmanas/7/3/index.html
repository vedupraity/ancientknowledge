[7-4(A)]</h5> <h5>utari kahēu prabhu puṣpakahi tumha kubēra pahiṃ jāhu.</h5> <h5>prērita rāma calēu sō haraṣu birahu ati tāhu..4kha.. [7-4(B)]</h5> <p>When the All-merciful Lord saw all the people coming out to meet Him, He urged on the aerial car to halt near the city and so it came down to the ground. On alighting from the car, the Lord said to the Puṣpaka, &ldquo;You now return to Kubera.&rdquo; Thus enjoined by Śrī Rāma, the aerial car, departed, full of joy and deep agony at parting.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>āē bharata saṃga saba lōgā. kṛsa tana śrīraghubīra biyōgā..</h5> <h5>bāmadēva basiṣṭha munināyaka. dēkhē prabhu mahi dhari dhanu sāyaka..

[7-4(B)-2]</h5> <h5>sakala dvijanha mili nāyau māthā. dharma dhuraṃdhara raghukulanāthā..</h5> <h5>gahē bharata puni prabhu pada paṃkaja. namata jinhahi sura muni saṃkara aja.. [7-4(B)-3]</h5> <h5>parē bhūmi nahiṃ uṭhata uṭhāē. bara kari kṛpāsiṃdhu ura lāē..</h5> <h5>syāmala gāta rōma bhaē ṭhāḍhaē. nava rājīva nayana jala bāḍhaē.. [7-4(B)-4]</h5> <p>Alongwith Bharata came all the other people, emaciated in body because of their separation from the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line. When the Lord saw the great sages Vāmadeva, Vasiṣṭha and others, He dropped His bow and arrows on the ground and ran with His brother (Lakṣmaṇa) to clasp His preceptor&rsquo;s lotus-feet with every hair on their body erect. Vasiṣṭha (the chief of the sages) embraced them (in return) and enquired after their welfare. Śrī Rāma replied, &ldquo;It is in your grace alone that our welfare lies.&rdquo; The Lord of Raghu&rsquo;s race, the champion of righteousness, now met all the other Brāhmaṇas and bowed His head to them. Then Bharata clasped the Lord&rsquo;s lotus-feet, which are adored by gods and sages, Śaṅkara and Brahma not excepted. He lay prostrate on the ground and would not rise even though being lifted up, till at last the All-merciful forcibly took and pressed him to His bosom. Every hair on His swarthy form stood erect and His lotus eyes were flooded with tears.</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>rājīva lōcana stravata jala tana lalita pulakāvali banī.</h5> <h5>ati prēma hṛdayaom lagāi anujahi milē prabhu tribhuana dhanī..</h5> <h5>prabhu milata anujahi sōha mō pahiṃ jāti nahiṃ upamā kahī.</h5> <h5>janu prēma aru siṃgāra tanu dhari milē bara suṣamā lahī..1.. [7-4(B)-1]</h5> <h5>būjhata kṛpānidhi kusala bharatahi bacana bēgi na āvaī.</h5> <h5>sunu sivā sō sukha bacana mana tē bhinna jāna jō pāvaī..</h5> <h5>aba kusala kausalanātha ārata jāni jana darasana diyō.</h5> <h5>būḍata biraha bārīsa kṛpānidhāna mōhi kara gahi liyō..2.. [7-4(B)-2]</h5> <p>His lotus eyes streamed with tears, while bristling hair served to adorn His comely person as Lord Śrī Rāma, the sovereign of the three spheres, clasped Bharata to His bosom with utmost affection. I find no parallel by which I may illustrate the beauty of the Lord&rsquo;s meeting with his younger brother: it seemed as though the Erotic sentiment and affection had met together in exquisite bodily form. The All-merciful enquired after Bharata&rsquo;s welfare; but words did not readily come to his help. Listen, Śiva: (continues Lord Śiva,) the bliss (which Bharata enjoyed at the moment) was beyond one&rsquo;s speech and mind; it is known only to those who feel it. &ldquo;All is now well with me, since the All-merciful Lord of Kosala has blessed me with His sight, realizing the distress of His servant, and taken me by the hand just when I was sinking in the ocean of desolation.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>puni prabhu haraṣi satruhana bhēṃṭē hṛdayaom lagāi.</h5> <h5>lachimana bharata milē taba parama prēma dōu bhāi..5.. [7-5]</h5> <p>The Lord then gladly met Śatrughna and pressed him to His bosom. Next came the turn of Lakṣmaṇa and Bharata and the two brothers embraced each other with utmost affection.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bharatānuja lachimana puni bhēṃṭē. dusaha biraha saṃbhava dukha mēṭē..</h5> <h5>sītā carana bharata siru nāvā. anuja samēta parama sukha pāvā.. [7-5-1]</h5> <h5>prabhu bilōki haraṣē purabāsī. janita biyōga bipati saba nāsī..</h5> <h5>prēmātura saba lōga nihārī. kautuka kīnha kṛpāla kharārī.. [7-5-2]</h5> <h5>amita rūpa pragaṭē tēhi kālā. jathājōga milē sabahi kṛpālā..</h5> <h5>kṛpādṛṣṭi raghubīra bilōkī. kiē sakala nara nāri bisōkī.. [7-5-3]</h5> <h5>chana mahiṃ sabahi milē bhagavānā. umā marama yaha kāhu na jānā..</h5> <h5>ēhi bidhi sabahi sukhī kari rāmā. āgēṃ calē sīla guna dhāmā.. [7-5-4]</h5> <h5>kausalyādi mātu saba dhāī. nirakhi baccha janu dhēnu lavāī.. [7-5-5]</h5> <p>Then Lakṣmaṇa embraced Śatrughna (Bharata&rsquo;s younger brother)* and thus relieved each other of the terrible agony of separation. Bharata and Śatrughna bowed their head at Sītā&rsquo;s feet and felt supreme delight. The citizens were transported with joy at the sight of the Lord. All the woes begotten of their separation from the Lord now ended. Seeing all the people impatient in thier love to meet the Lord, the All-merciful Slayer of Khara wrought a miracle. He forthwith appeared in countless forms and in this way the gracious Lord met everybody in an appropriate manner. The Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line rid all men and women of their sorrow by casting His benign look on them. In a moment the Lord greeted them all; Umā, this was a mystery which none could comprehend. Having thus gratified all, Śrī Rāma, who was a repository of amiability and goodness, proceeded further. Kausalyā and the other mothers all ran out to meet Him, even as a cow that has lately calved would run at the sight of its little one.</p> <ul> <li><strong>*</strong> Although Lakṣmaṇa and Śatrughna were real brothers, the latter bore greater affinity to Bharata and preferred to live with him. Hence he is referred to here as Bharata&rsquo;s younger brother. </ul> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>janu dhēnu bālaka baccha taji gṛhaom carana bana parabasa gaīṃ.</h5> <h5>dina aṃta pura rukha stravata thana huṃkāra kari dhāvata bhaī..</h5> <h5>ati prēma saba mātu bhēṭīṃ bacana mṛdu bahubidhi kahē.</h5> <h5>gai biṣama biyōga bhava tinha haraṣa sukha aganita lahē..</h5> <p>It seemed as though cows that had recently calved and had been forced to go out to the woods for grazing, leaving their little ones at home, had at the close of day rushed forth lowing towards the village with dripping teats. The Lord met all the mothers with utmost affection and spoke many a soft words to them. In this way the dire calamity that had come upon them as a result of separation from Śrī Rāma came to an end and they derived infinite joy and gratification.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhēṭēu tanaya sumitrāom rāma carana rati jāni.</h5> <h5>rāmahi milata kaikēī hṛdayaom bahuta sakucāni..6ka.. [7-6(A)]</h5> <h5>lachimana saba mātanha mili haraṣē āsiṣa pāi.</h5> <h5>kaikēi kahaom puni puni milē mana kara chōbhu na jāi..6.. [7-6(B)]</h5> <p>Sumitrā embraced her son (Lakṣmaṇa) remembering how devoted he was to Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet. As for Kaikeyī, she felt very uncomfortable at heart while embracing Śrī Rāma. Lakṣmaṇa too embraced all his mothers and was delighted to receive their blessings. But even though he met Kaikeyī again and again, his bitterness of feeling towards her did not leave him.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sāsunha sabani milī baidēhī. carananhi lāgi haraṣu ati tēhī..</h5> <h5>dēhiṃ asīsa būjhi kusalātā. hōi acala tumhāra ahivātā..

[7-6(B)-4]</h5> <p>Videha&rsquo;s Daughter (Sītā) greeted all Her mothers-in-law and was transported with joy as She clasped their feet. They enquired after Her welfare and blessed Her : &ldquo;May your married life be happy forever.&rdquo; All gazed upon the lotus face of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus) and, remembering that it was an occasion for rejoicing, checked the tears that rose in their eyes. Burning festal lights in gold plates they waved them above Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s head (in order to ward off evil forces) and again and again contemplated the Lord&rsquo;s person. They scattered every kind of offering about Him (in order to avert an evil eye), their heart full of supreme felicity and jubilation. Again and again did Kausalyā gaze upon the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line, who was an ocean of compassion and an irresistible warrior, each time pondering within herself : &ldquo;How can he have killed the lord of Laṅkā? Too delicate of body are my two boys, while the demons were great champions of extraordinary might !&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>lachimana aru sītā sahita prabhuhi bilōkati mātu.</h5> <h5>paramānaṃda magana mana puni puni pulakita gātu..7.. [7-7]</h5> <p>As the mother (Kausalyā) looked upon the Lord with Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā, her soul was overwhelmed with supreme felicity and the hair on her body bristled up again and again.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>laṃkāpati kapīsa nala nīlā. jāmavaṃta aṃgada subhasīlā..</h5> <h5>hanumadādi saba bānara bīrā. dharē manōhara manuja sarīrā.. [7-7-1]</h5> <h5>bharata sanēha sīla brata nēmā. sādara saba baranahiṃ ati prēmā..</h5> <h5>dēkhi nagarabāsinha kai rītī. sakala sarāhahi prabhu pada prītī..

[7-7-4]</h5> <h5>suni prabhu bacana magana saba bhaē. nimiṣa nimiṣa upajata sukha naē.. [7-7-5]</h5> <p>Vibhīṣaṇa (the king of Laṅkā), Sugrīva (the lord of the monkeys), Nala, Nīla, Jāmbavān, Aṅgada, Hanumān and the other monkey heroes, who were all of a virtuous disposition, had assumed charming human forms. With great reverence and love all applauded Bharata&rsquo;s affection, amiability, austerities and discipline. When they saw the citizens&rsquo; mode of life, they all extolled their devotion to the Lord&rsquo;s feet. Then the Lord of the Raghus summoned all His comrades and exhorted them: &ldquo;Clasp the feet of My Guru, the sage Vasiṣṭha, who is worthy of adoration to our whole race. It was by his grace that all the demons were slain in battle.&rdquo; &ldquo;(Turning to the sage) Listen, holy Sir : all these My comrades proved as so many barks in taking Me across the ocean of the battle. They staked their life in My cause: they are dearer to Me even than Bharata.&rdquo; They were all enraptured to hear the Lord&rsquo;s word; every moment that passed gave birth to some new joy.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kausalyā kē carananhi puni tinha nāyau mātha..</h5> <h5>āsiṣa dīnhē haraṣi tumha priya mama jimi raghunātha..8ka.. [7-8(A)]</h5> <h5>sumana bṛṣṭi nabha saṃkula bhavana calē sukhakaṃda.</h5> <h5>caḍhaī aṭārinha dēkhahiṃ nagara nāri nara bṛṃda..8kha.. [7-8(B)]</h5> <p>Then they bowed their heads at Kausalyā&rsquo;s feet, who rejoiced to give them her blessing, adding : &ldquo;You are as dear to me as the Lord of the Raghus.&rdquo; The sky was obscured with the showers of flowers as the Fountain of joy took His way to the palace. Throngs of men and women of the city mounted the attics to have a look at the Lord.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kaṃcana kalasa bicitra saomvārē. sabahiṃ dharē saji nija nija dvārē..</h5> <h5>baṃdanavāra patākā kētū. sabanhi banāē maṃgala hētū..

[7-8(B)-4]</h5> <h5>tēu yaha carita dēkhi ṭhagi rahahīṃ. umā tāsu guna nara kimi kahahīṃ.. [7-8(B)-5]</h5> <p>All the people placed at their door vases of gold picturesquely decorated and equipped with necessary articles. Everyone prepared and set festoons, flags and buntings, all to make a glad show. All the streets were sprinkled with perfumes and scented water and a number of mystic squares were drawn and filled in with pearls found in the projections of an elephant&rsquo;s forehead. Every kind of festive preparation was taken in hand; the city was en fete and a large number of kettledrums sounded all at once. Ladies scattered their offerings about the Lord wherever He went, and invoked blessing on Him with their hearts full of joy. Bevies of young women sang festal songs, while gold plates provided with lights were ready at hand, which they waved about the Lord, who is the Reliever of all agony and brought delight to Raghu&rsquo;s race even as the sun delights a bed of lotuses. The splendour, the wealth and the good fortune of the city have been extolled by the Vedas, Śeṣa (the serpent-god) and Śāradā (the goddess of speech and learning). But they too were dazed to see this spectacle. Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) how, then, can any mortal recount His virtues?</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>nāri kumudinīṃ avadha sara raghupati biraha dinēsa.</h5> <h5>asta bhaēom bigasata bhaīṃ nirakhi rāma rākēsa..9ka.. [7-9(A)]</h5> <h5>hōhiṃ saguna subha bibidha bidhi bājahiṃ gagana nisāna.</h5> <h5>pura nara nāri sanātha kari bhavana calē bhagavāna..9kha.. [7-9(B)]</h5> <p>The women, who were like water-lilies growing in the lake of Ayodhyā and had been withered by the sun in the form of separation from the Lord of the Raghus, blossomed again at the sight of Śrī Rāma, who resembled the full moon, the sun of separation having now set. Auspicious omens of every description occurred and kettledrums sounded in the sky as the Lord proceeded to the palace after blessing the men and women of the city with His sight.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>prabhu jānī kaikēī lajānī. prathama tāsu gṛha gaē bhavānī..</h5> <h5>tāhi prabōdhi bahuta sukha dīnhā. puni nija bhavana gavana hari kīnhā..

[7-9(B)-4]</h5> <p>Bhavānī, (continues Lord Śiva,) the Lord came to know that Kaikeyī was ashamed and went first to her palace. After reassuring and gratifying her much Śrī Hari (Śrī Rāma) then moved to His own palace. When the All-merciful entered the palace, every man and woman of the city felt gratified. The preceptor, Vasiṣṭha called the Brāhmaṇas and said to them, &ldquo;The day and the hour, nay, all the other factors are favourable today. Therefore, all of you, Brāhmaṇas, be pleased to order that Śrī Rāmacandra may occupy the royal throne.&rdquo; On hearing the agreeable words of the sage Vasiṣṭha all the Brāhmaṇas warmly welcomed them. Many of the Brāhmaṇas spoke in endearing terms, &ldquo;Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s coronation will bring delight to the whole world. Delay no more, O good sage, but apply the sacred mark on the forehead of His Majesty as a token of sovereignty.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>taba muni kahēu sumaṃtra sana sunata calēu haraṣāi.</h5> <h5>ratha anēka bahu bāji gaja turata saomvārē jāi..10ka..
