Listen. O lord of the winged creatures; the fools who ignore Bhakti and seek happiness by any other means stupidly seek to swim across the ocean without the help of a vessel&rdquo;. Garuḍa, O Bhavānī, (continues Lord Śaṅkara,) rejoiced to hear Bhuśuṇḍi&rsquo;s words and submitted in gentle accents : &ldquo;By your grace, my lord, doubt, sorrow, error and delusion have disappeared from my heart. I have also listened to the praises of Śrī Rāma and attained peace of mind by your blessing. My lord, I ask you one question more: pray, explain the whole thing clearly, O ocean of compassion. The saints and sages as well as the Vedas and Purāṇas declare that there is nothing so difficult of attainment as wisdom. Although the sage (Lomaśa) instructed you in the same, my lord, you did not show the same amount of regard for Gnosis as for Devotion. Explain to me, my gracious lord, all the difference between Gnosis and Devotion.&rdquo; The sagacious crow was gratified to hear the question of Garuḍa (the enemy of the serpents) and politely replied, &ldquo;There is no difference whatsoever between Gnosis and Devotion : both are equally efficacious in relieving the torments of birth and death. Great sages nonetheless point out some difference between the two, my lord: listen to the same with rapt attention, O chief of the birds ! Wisdom, dispassion, Yoga (union with God) and Realization-mark me-are all masculine in conception, O mount of Śrī Hari ! The might of man is formidable indeed; while a woman is naturally weak and dull by her very birth.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>puruṣa tyāgi saka nārihi jō birakta mati dhīra..</h5> <h5>na tu kāmī biṣayābasa bimukha jō pada raghubīra..115ka..

[7-115(A)-115(B)]</h5> <p>But that man alone who is unattached and resolute of mind can forwear woman- not the sensual voluptuary, who has turned his face against the feet of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line). But even such an enlightened sage, O mount of Śrī Hari, succumbs to the charms of a pretty woman at the very sight of her moon-like face. It is God Viṣṇu&rsquo;s own Māyā (deluding potency) that manifests itself in the form of a woman!</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>ihāom na pacchapāta kachu rākhau. bēda purāna saṃta mata bhāṣau..</h5> <h5>mōha na nāri nāri kēṃ rūpā. pannagāri yaha rīti anūpā..

[7-115(A)-4]</h5> <p>Here I do not speak in a partisan spirit, but merely state the view of the Vedas and Purāṇas as well as of the saints. A woman is never enamoured of another woman&rsquo;s beauty : this, O enemy of the serpents, is a strange phenomenon. Māyā and Bhakti (Devotion), mark me, both belong to the feminine group, as everyone knows. Again, Bhakti is beloved of Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line); while poor Māyā is a mere dancing girl. The Lord of the Raghus is well-disposed towards Bhakti; hence Māyā is terribly afraid of her. Nay, Māyā shrinks at the very sight of the man in whose heart ever abides unobstructed the peerless and guileless spirit of Devotion, and cannot wield her authority over him. Knowing this, sages who have realized the Truth solicit Bhakti, which is the fountain of all blessings.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>yaha rahasya raghunātha kara bēgi na jānai kōi.</h5> <h5>jō jānai raghupati kṛpāom sapanēhu mōha na hōi..116ka..

Further hear, most sagacious Garuḍa, the distinction between Gnosis and Devotion, by hearing which one develops perpetual and uninterrupted love for Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sunahu tāta yaha akatha kahānī. samujhata banai na jāi bakhānī..</h5> <h5>īsvara aṃsa jīva abināsī. cētana amala sahaja sukha rāsī..

[7-116(B)-8]</h5> <p>Listen, dear Garuḍa, to this unutterable romance, which can only be comprehended by the mind but is incapable of expression. The soul is a particle of the Divinity, immortal, conscious, untainted by Māyā and blissful by nature. Such a soul, my lord, has allowed itself to be dominated by Māyā and has been caught in its own trap like a parrot or a monkey*. Matter and Spirit have been linked together with a knot which, though imaginary, is difficult to untie. Since then the soul has become worldly: it can have no happiness till this knot is untied. The Vedas and Purāṇas have suggested a number of devices for untying the knot; but the knot, far from being resolved, becomes harder and harder. The interior of the soul being utterly clouded with the darkness of ignorance, the knot cannot even be perceived; how, then, can it be untied? If God were to bring about such conditions (as are depicted below), even then the disentanglement of the knot is problematical. Suppose by the grace of Śrī Hari the blessed cow in the shape of Sāttvika (genuine) piety comes to abide in one&rsquo;s heart and feeds on green herbage in the shape of Japa (muttering of prayers), austere penance, sacred observances, the Yamas or forms of self-restraint (viz., continence, veracity, non-violence, non-stealing and non-possession), the five Niyamas or positive virtues (viz., external and internal purity, contentment, self- study, self-discipline and self-surrender to God) and innumerable other blessed virtues and religious practices recommended by the Vedas. Milk begins to flow from her teats, let us hope, when she is united with her newly-born calf in the form of love. Quietism serves as the cord by which her hind legs are tied (in order to milk her); faith represents the pot in which the cow is milked; while a pure mind, which is at one&rsquo;s beck and call, plays the role of a milker. Having thus drawn the milk in the shape of supreme righteousness one should boil it, brother, on the fire of desirelessness. When boiled, it should be cooled down with the breath of contentment and forbearance and congealed by mixing with it a little curd in the shape of fortitude and mind-control. The curd thus made should be churned in the earthen vase of cheerfulness with the churning-stick of reflection after fastening the stick to the host of self-restraint with the cord of truthful and agreeable words; and by this process of churning one should extract the pure, excellent and holy butter of dispassion.</p> <ul> <li><strong>*</strong> The allusion is to two popular modes of catching parrots and monkeys. A stick with a bait at the end and a string attached to it is so set in the ground that it revolves from the weight of the parrot when it lights upon it; and the bird, confused by the motion, fancies it is entangled in the string, though it is really loose and might fly away if it tried. For the monkey a large jar, with a narrow mouth, is sunk in the ground full of grain. The monkey puts in his hand and clutches a handful; but being unable to draw out his closed fist on account of the smallness of the jar&rsquo;s mouth, he fancies himself caught, though if he stretches the palm of his hand he could extricate it immediately. </ul> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jōga agini kari pragaṭa taba karma subhāsubha lāi.</h5> <h5>buddhi sirāvaiṃ gyāna ghṛta mamatā mala jari jāi..117ka..

[7-117(C)-117(D)]</h5> <p>After kindling the fire of Yoga (concentration of mind) one&rsquo;s past Karma, both good and evil, should be consigned to it as fuel, and the butter placed on it. When the scum in the form of worldly attachment is burnt, the ghee (clarified butter) that is left in the form of Gnosis should be cooled down by Buddhi (Reason). Having obtained this pure ghee (in the form of wisdom), Buddhi, which is of the nature of understanding, should fill with it the lamp of the Citta (reasoning faculty), and making a stand of even-mindedness set the lamp securely there. Extracting cotton in the form of the transcendental state out of the boll of the three states of conciousness (viz., waking, dream and dreamless sleep) and the three modes of Prakṛti (viz., Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) the same should be carded and fashioned into a strong wick. In this manner one should light the glorious lamp of immediate knowledge, by merely approaching which moths in the shape of vanity etc., are all consumed.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sōhamasmi iti bṛtti akhaṃḍā. dīpa sikhā sōi parama pracaṃḍā..</h5> <h5>ātama anubhava sukha suprakāsā. taba bhava mūla bhēda bhrama nāsā..

[7-117(C)-8]</h5> <p>The constant awareness that &ldquo;I am the same (Brahma)&rdquo; represents the most dazzling flame of the lamp. In this way when the bliss of Self-Realization sheds its bright lustre, the error of duality, the root of worldly existence, is dispersed and the infinite darkness of infatuation etc.- which forms the family of Avidyā (Nescience)-disappears. Having thus procured a light, the Buddhi referred to above sits in the chamber of the heart to untie the ligature (that binds the Spirit with Matter). The soul can hope to attain its object only in the event of Buddhi succeeding in untying it. But when Māyā, O king of the birds, finds her attempting to untie the knot, she creates many difficulties. She sends forth, brother, a number of Ṛddhis and Siddhis (riches and supernatural powers in their embodied forms), that try to excite her cupidity. By artifice, force or fraud they approach her and put off the light by fanning it with the end of their garment. If the Buddhi happens to be most sagacious, she refuses even to look at them considering them to be her enemies. If these impediments fail to distract her, the gods next proceed to create trouble. The various appertures of the body that locate the five senses are so many windows in the chamber of the heart, each of which is presided over by a god. Even as they find the gust of sensuality entering the chamber the gods wantonly throw the shutters of these appertures wide open. As soon as the blast penetrates the chamber of the heart the light of immediate knowledge gets extinguished. In this way while the ligature binding the Spirit with Matter remains untied, the light (of Self-Realization) also disappears and the understanding gets bewildered when buffetted by the blast of sensuality. Gnosis is welcome neither to the senses nor the gods presiding over them, who are ever fond of sensuous enjoyments. And the Buddhi too having been distracted by the blast of sensuality, who can light the lamp again as before?</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>taba phiri jīva bibidha bidhi pāvai saṃsṛti klēsa.</h5> <h5>hari māyā ati dustara tari na jāi bihagēsa..118ka..

[7-118(B)]</h5> <p>(When the light of wisdom is thus extinguished) the soul then goes again through the manifold agonies of transmigration. Śrī Hari&rsquo;s deluding potency, O lord of the winged creatures, is most difficult to cross: it cannot easily be crossed over. Gnosis is difficult to expound,difficult to grasp and difficult to achive through practice. And if by chance one succeeds in attaining it, there are many impediments in the way of preserving it.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>gyāna paṃtha kṛpāna kai dhārā. parata khagēsa hōi nahiṃ bārā..</h5> <h5>jō nirbighna paṃtha nirbahaī. sō kaivalya parama pada lahaī..

He alone who successfully treads it attains to the supreme state of final emancipation. But this supreme state of final beatitude is most difficult to attain, so declare the saints as well as the Purāṇas, Vedas and Āgamas (Tantras). By worshipping Śrī Rāma, my lord, the same beatitude comes unsolicited even against our will. Water cannot stay except on land notwithstanding our best efforts; even so, mark you, O king of the birds, the joy of final beatitude cannot stay apart from Devotion to Śrī Hari. Realizing this, the wise devotees of Śrī Hari spurn final emancipation and remain enamoured of Devotion. By practising Devotion ignorance, which is the root of metempsychosis, is eradicated without any effort or exertion, in the same way as we eat for our own gratification but the gastric fire digests the food so eaten (without any effort on our part). What fool is there who does not welcome such Devotion to Śrī Hari, which is so easy and delightful at the same time?</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sēvaka sēbya bhāva binu bhava na taria uragāri..</h5> <h5>bhajahu rāma pada paṃkaja asa siddhāṃta bicāri..119ka..

Knowing this to be the established doctrine, adore the lotus feet of Śrī Rāma. The Lord of the Raghus can make the animate inanimate and the inanimate animate: the souls that adore such an omnipotent lord are blessed indeed.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kahēu gyāna siddhāṃta bujhāī. sunahu bhagati mani kai prabhutāī..</h5> <h5>rāma bhagati ciṃtāmani suṃdara. basai garuḍa jākē ura aṃtara..

[7-119(B)-10]</h5> <p>I have expounded at length the established doctrine relating to Gnosis; hear now the virtue of Devotion, which has been likened to a jewel. The beautiful wish-yielding gem of Devotion to Śrī Rāma is an embodiment of supreme effulgence, which sheds its radiance day and night, requiring neither a vessel nor clarified butter nor a wick (to light it). He in whose heart, O Garuḍa, such a jewel abides is not haunted by poverty in the shade of infatuation. No blast of greed can ever extinguish this light, which dispels the overpowering gloom of ignorance and the swarms of moths (in the shape of vanity etc.,) keep away from it in a mood of frustration. Nay, vicious propensities like lust dare not approach him in whose heart the gem of Devotion abides. For him venom is transformed into ambrosia and enemies turn into friends; nobody can attain happiness without this jewel. Again, he is never attacked by the terrible mental diseases from which all living beings are grievously suffering. He in whose heart the gem of Devotion to Śrī Rāma abides cannot have the least woe even in a dream. They alone are paragons of wisdom in this world; who spare no pains to secure this gem. Although this jewel is manifest in the world, none can find it without the grace of Śrī Rāma. There are easy devices for finding it, but luckless souls attempt harder methods. The Vedas and Purāṇas represent holy mountains; and the stories of Śrī Rāma, the many glorious mines located in their midst. The saints are the expert minerologists and their penetrating intellect, the pickaxe; while spiritual wisdom and dispassion, Garuḍa, are the two eyes (surveying the mines). Any creature who looks for it with faith succeeds in discovering the gem of Devotion, a mine of all blessings. I have this conviction in my heart, my lord, that a servant of Śrī Rāma is greater than Śrī Rāma Himself. While Śrī Rāma is the ocean, the wise saints are like the rain-clouds; or (to use another metaphor) while Śrī Hari is the sandal-tree, the saints represent the winds (that diffuse its perfume). Devotion to Śrī Hari, which is so delightful, is the reward of all spiritual endeavours; none has ever secured it except through a saint. Realizing this whoever cultivates the fellowship of saints finds Devotion to Śrī Rāma easy of attainment, O king of the birds.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>brahma payōnidhi maṃdara gyāna saṃta sura āhiṃ.</h5> <h5>kathā sudhā mathi kāḍhahiṃ bhagati madhuratā jāhiṃ..120ka.. [7-120(A)]</h5> <h5>birati carma asi gyāna mada lōbha mōha ripu māri.</h5> <h5>jaya pāia sō hari bhagati dēkhu khagēsa bicāri..120kha.. [7-120(B)]</h5> <p>The Vedas are compared to the ocean (of milk); spiritual wisdom plays the role of Mount Mandara; while saints are the gods who churn out nectar in the form of the sacred legends; and Devotion represents its sweetness. Using Dispassion as a shield (for self-defence) and slaying with the sword of wisdom enemies in the form of vanity, greed and infatuation, it is Devotion to Śrī Hari that triumphs; ponder and realize this, O king of the birds.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-5 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/17" > <span>Previous (Part - 17)</span> </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/19" > <span>Next (Part - 19)</span> </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (Tulsi Ramayana)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>7 - Uttar Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/7/18"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part - 18</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-title> Select language </swal-title> <swal-input type=select  value=hi  /> <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/language-selector.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
