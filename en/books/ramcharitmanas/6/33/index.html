[6-109(B)]</h5> <p>The gods in their delight rained down flowers and kettledrums sounded in the air. The Kiṁnaras sang their melodies and the celestial nymphs danced, all mounted on their aerial cars. The beauty of the Lord reunited with Janaka&rsquo;s Daughter was beyond all measure and bound. The bears and monkeys rejoiced at the sight and shouted &ldquo;Glory to the Lord of the Raghus, the essence of bliss.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>taba raghupati anusāsana pāī. mātali calēu carana siru nāī..</h5> <h5>āē dēva sadā svārathī. bacana kahahiṃ janu paramārathī..

Now came the gods, ever alive to their own selfish interests, and spoke words as though they were seekers of the highest truth : &ldquo;Friend of the meek, gracious, and divine Lord of the Raghus, you have shown mercy to the gods. This sensual wretch, who took delight in doing mischief to the whole world and trod the evil way, has perished through his own sins. You are alike to all, the imperishable Brahma, ever unchangeable, impartial by nature, integral, devoid of material properties, unborn, sinless, immutable, invincible, unfailing in power, and full of compassion. It was You who assumed the form of a fish, a tortoise; a boar, a man-lion and a dwarf as well as that of Paraśurāma. Whenever, O Lord, the gods have been in trouble, You have put an end to it by appearing in one form or other. This impure wretch, a perpetual enemy of the gods, was given up to lust, greed and vanity, and very passionate too. That even this vilest creature attained Your state is a marvel to us. We gods are supremely qualified (for the highest state): yet, devoted as we are to our own selfish ends, we have forgotten the worship of our lord and are ever involved in the flood of birth and death. Now redeem us, O Lord, since we have sought shelter in You.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kari binatī sura siddha saba rahē jahaom tahaom kara jōri.</h5> <h5>ati saprēma tana pulaki bidhi astuti karata bahōri..110.. [6-110]</h5> <p>Having thus made their supplication, the gods and Siddhas all remained standing where they were with joined palms. Then, thrilling all over with excess of love, Brahmā (the Creator) commenced his prayer.</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>jaya rāma sadā sukhadhāma harē. raghunāyaka sāyaka cāpa dharē..</h5> <h5>bhava bārana dārana siṃha prabhō. guna sāgara nāgara nātha bibhō..

[6-110-11]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Glory to You, O Rāma, perpetual abode of bliss. O Hari (the reliever of suffering), O Chief of the Raghus, bearing a bow and arrows! Lord, You are a veritable lion to tear in pieces the elephant of mundane existence, and an ocean of virtues, my clever and omnipresent Master. In Your person stands concentrated the incomparable beauty of a myriad Cupids; Siddhas, as well as the greatest of sages and bards sing Your praises. Your glory is not only sacred, it purifies all; in Your wrath You seized Rāvaṇa even as Garuḍa (the king of the birds) might seize a huge serpent. Delight of devotees, and dispeller of their grief and fear, You are ever unmoved by passion, and are all- intelligence, my lord. Your descent on the mortal plane is beneficent and full of untold virtues: You come to relieve Earth&rsquo;s burdens and Your manifestations on earth are wisdom personified. (Though descended on earth,) You are ever unborn, omnipresent, one (without a second) and beginningless. I gladly bow to You, O Rāma, fountain of mercy ! Ornament of Raghu&rsquo;s race and Slayer of demon Dūṣaṇa (Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s Cousin), You eradicate the faults of Your devotees and made Vibhīṣaṇa, destitute as he was, the Ruler of Laṅkā. Storehouse of virtue and wisdom and beyond all measure, You have no pride in You and are unborn, all pervading and free from the taint of Māyā; I constantly adore You, Rāma. Terrible is the glory and might of Your arms, which are deft in exterminating the hordes of the impious. Compassionate and friendly to the poor without any ostensible reason and a reservoir of beauty, I adore You alongwith Rāma (Sītā). Deliverer from the rounds of birth and death, You are beyond both cause (Prakṛti) and effect (the phenomenal universe) and eradicate the awful weaknesses of the (devotee&rsquo;s) mind. Armed with a charming bow, arrows, and quiver, You have eyes resembling a red lotus. A paragon of kings, home of bliss, Lakṣmī&rsquo;s lovely Consort, subduer of arrogance, lust and the false sense of mineness, You are free from blemish integral and imperceptible to the senses. Though manifest in all forms, You never transmuted Yourself into them all: so declare the Vedas; it is no mere gossip, as will be clear from the analogy of the sun and the sunshine, which are different and yet identical. Blessed are all these monkeys, O ubiquitous Lord, who reverently gaze on Your countenance; while accursed, O Hari, is our (so-called) immortal existence and our ethereal bodies in that we lack in devotion to You and are lost in worldly pleasures. Now show Your mercy to me, compassionate as You are to the afflicted, and take away my differentiating sense (which makes the world appear as apart from You), which leads me to wrong action and deluded by which I pass my days in merriment, mistaking woe for happiness. Destroyer of the wicked and lovely jewel of the earth, Your lotus feet are adored even by Śambhu (Lord Śiva) and Umā (Goddess Pārvatī). O King of kings, grant me this boon that I may cherish loving devotion to Your lotus feet, which is a perennial source of blessings.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>binaya kīnhi caturānana prēma pulaka ati gāta.</h5> <h5>sōbhāsiṃdhu bilōkata lōcana nahīṃ aghāta..111.. [6-111]</h5> <p>As the four-faced Brahma thus prayed, his body was deeply thrilled with emotion. And his eyes knew no satiation as they gazed on the Ocean of beauty.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>tēhi avasara dasaratha tahaom āē. tanaya bilōki nayana jala chāē..</h5> <h5>anuja sahita prabhu baṃdana kīnhā. āsirabāda pitāom taba dīnhā..</h5> <h5>tāta sakala tava punya prabhāū. jītyōṃ ajaya nisācara rāū..</h5> <h5>suni suta bacana prīti ati bāḍhaī. nayana salila rōmāvali ṭhāḍhaī..</h5> <h5>raghupati prathama prēma anumānā. citai pitahi dīnhēu dṛḍha gyānā..</h5> <h5>tātē umā mōccha nahiṃ pāyō. dasaratha bhēda bhagati mana lāyō..</h5> <h5>sagunōpāsaka mōccha na lēhīṃ. tinha kahu rāma bhagati nija dēhīṃ..</h5> <h5>bāra bāra kari prabhuhi pranāmā. dasaratha haraṣi gaē suradhāmā..</h5> <p>That very moment King Daśaratha appeared on the scene (in his celestial form); his eyes were flooded with tears as he beheld his son (Śrī Rāma). The Lord and His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) made obeisance and the father in his turn gave them his blessing. &ldquo;Dear father, it was all due to your religious merit that I conquered the invincible demon king.&rdquo; Daśaratha was overwhelmed with emotion when he heard his son&rsquo;s words; tears rushed to his eyes again and the hair on his body stood erect. The Lord of the Raghus understood that His father bore the same affection for Him as he did before; He, therefore, looked at His father and bestowed on him solid wisdom. Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) Daśaratha did not attain final beatitude for this simple reason that he set his heart on Devotion while maintaining his separate identity. Worshippers of God in His embodied form spurn final beatitude: to them Śrī Rāma vouchsafes devotion to His own person. Having prostrated himself before the Lord again and again, Daśaratha joyfully returned to his abode in heaven.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>anuja jānakī sahita prabhu kusala kōsalādhīsa.</h5> <h5>sōbhā dēkhi haraṣi mana astuti kara sura īsa..112.. [6-112]</h5> <p>Perceiving the Almighty Lord of Kosala safe and sound with His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) and Janaka&rsquo;s Daughter, and beholding their beauty, Indra (the Lord of the celestials) began extolling Him with a cheerful heart:-</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>jaya rāma sōbhā dhāma. dāyaka pranata biśrāma..</h5> <h5>dhṛta trōna bara sara cāpa. bhujadaṃḍa prabala pratāpa..1..

[6-112-8]</h5> <p>Glory to Śrī Rāma, beauty personified, the bestower of peace on the suppliant, equipped with an excellent bow, arrows and quiver and triumphing in His mighty strength of arm. Glory to the Slayer of Dūṣaṇa and Khara and the crusher of the demon hordes! Now that You have disposed of this wretch, my lord, all the gods enjoy full security. Glory to the Reliever of Earth&rsquo;s burden, whose greatness is beneficent and unbounded. Glory to the All-merciful Slayer of Rāvaṇa, who reduced the demon host to a miserable plight. Outrageous was the pride of Rāvaṇa (the lord of Laṅkā), who had subdued even gods and Gandharvas (the celestial musicians). Nay, he relentlessly pursued sages, the Siddhas, human beings, birds and Nāgas alike. He took delight in injuring others and was most wicked; the vile sinner has now reaped the fruit of his misdeeds. Now listen, my lord, possessed of eyes as large as the lotus and compassionate to the humble: my pride was inordinate; I accounted no one as equal to me. At the sight of Your lotus feet, however, my pride, which entailed much woe, has taken leave of me. Some people meditate on the attributeless Brahma (the Absolute), whom the Vedas declare as unmanifest. What attracts my mind, however, is the Supreme embodied as Śrī Rāma, King of Kosala. Together with Videha&rsquo;s Daughter and Your younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa), therefore, pray abide in my heart; and recognizing me as Your own servant, bless me with devotion, O Abode of Rāma (Lakṣmī).</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>dē bhakti ramānivāsa trāsa harana sarana sukhadāyakaṃ.</h5> <h5>sukha dhāma rāma namāmi kāma anēka chabi raghunāyakaṃ..</h5> <h5>sura bṛṃda raṃjana dvaṃda bhaṃjana manuja tanu atulitabalaṃ.</h5> <h5>brahmādi saṃkara sēbya rāma namāmi karunā kōmalaṃ..</h5> <p>&ldquo;Grant me devotion to Your feet, O Abode of Rāma, dispeller of fear and solace of the suppliant.

[6-113-5]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Listen, King of the gods: our monkeys and bears, those that were killed by the demons, are lying on the ground. They have laid down their lives in my service: therefore, restore them all to life, O wise lord of the celestials.&rdquo; Listen, O king of the birds: (continues Kākabhuśuṇḍi,) these words of the Lord are profoundly mysterious; only enlightened sages can apprehend them. The Lord Himself can wipe out the inhabitants of the three spheres and bring them back to life; He wished only to give Indra honour. By a shower of nectar the latter restored the monkeys and bears to life. They all arose with delight and betook themselves to the Lord. Although the shower of nectar promiscuously fell on the dead of both the armies, it is the bears and monkeys alone that returned to life, but not the demons. Their mind was absorbed in the thought of Śrī Rāma when they gave up the ghost; that is why they got liberated and were rid of the bonds of mundane existence. As for the monkeys and bears, they were all part manifestations of the gods (who are all immortal): hence they all came to life by the will of Śrī Rāma (the Lord of the Raghus). Is there anyone so kind to the afflicted as Śrī Rāma, who liberated the whole demon host? Even the wicked Rāvaṇa, who was a sink of impurities and given up to sensuality, attained to an exalted state which is withheld even from the greatest of sages.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sumana baraṣi saba sura calē caḍhai caḍhai rucira bimāna.</h5> <h5>dēkhi suavasaru prabhu pahiṃ āyau saṃbhu sujāna..114ka..

[6-114(B)]</h5> <p>After raining down flowers the gods mounted each his own shining aerial car and departed. Finding it a welcome opportunity the all-wise Śambhu (Lord Śiva) arrived in the presence of the Lord. Most lovingly, with joined palms, His lotus eyes full of tears and the hair on His body standing erect, the Slayer of the demon Tripura made the following supplication with choked voice :-</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>māmabhirakṣaya raghukula nāyaka. dhṛta bara cāpa rucira kara sāyaka..</h5> <h5>mōha mahā ghana paṭala prabhaṃjana. saṃsaya bipina anala sura raṃjana..1..

[6-114(B)-5]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Save me, Chief of Raghu&rsquo;s line, bearing an excellent bow and shining arrows in Your hands. A furious wind to disperse the mass of clouds in the shape of colossal ignorance, a fire to consume the forest of doubts, and delight of the gods, You are both with and without attributes, a shrine of virtues and most lovely to look at; nay, You are a burning midday Sun to scatter the darkness of delusion. A veritable lion to kill the elephants of lust, anger and pride, pray, constantly abide in the forest of the devotee&rsquo;s mind. A severe frost to blast the lotus bed of sensual desires, You are generous beyond conception. Nay, playing the role of Mount Mandara for churning the ocean of mundane existence, kindly stave off my fear (of birth and death) and transport me across the stormy ocean of mundane existence. Possessed of a swarthy form with lotus eyes, befriender of the meek, reliever of the suppliant&rsquo;s agony, take up Your abode in my heart for ever, O King Rāma, with Your younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) and Janaka&rsquo;s Daughter, O Delight of the sages, Jewel of the terrestrial globe, lord of Tulasīdāsa and destroyer of fear.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>nātha jabahiṃ kōsalapurīṃ hōihi tilaka tumhāra.</h5> <h5>kṛpāsiṃdhu maiṃ āuba dēkhana carita udāra..115..
