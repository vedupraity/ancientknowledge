[6-16(A)-4]</h5> <p>At this end the Lord of the Raghus woke at daybreak and, summoning all His counsellors, asked their opinion: &ldquo;Tell me quickly what course should be adopted.&rdquo; Jāmbavān bowed his head at the Lord&rsquo;s feet and said, &ldquo;Listen, O omniscient Lord, indweller of all hearts, storehouse of wisdom, strength, glory, piety and goodness: I offer advice to You according to my own lights. It is that Vāli&rsquo;s son (Prince Aṅgada) may be sent as an envoy (to Rāvaṇa).&rdquo; The good counsel commended itself to all and the Allmerciful turned to Aṅgada and said, &ldquo;O son of Vāli, repository of wisdom, strength and goodness! go to Laṅkā, dear son, for My cause. I need not give you any elaborate instructions. I know you are supremely clever. You should talk with the enemy in such words as may advance My cause and serve his interest at the same time.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Sortas</h4> <h5>prabhu agyā dhari sīsa carana baṃdi aṃgada uṭhēu.</h5> <h5>sōi guna sāgara īsa rāma kṛpā jā para karahu..17ka..

[6-17(B)]</h5> <p>Bowing to the Lord&rsquo;s command and adoring His feet, Aṅgada arose and said, &ldquo;He alone is an ocean of virtues, on whom You shower Your grace, O divine Rāma.&rdquo; &ldquo;All the objects of my Lord are self-accomplished,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;He has only honoured me (by charging me with this task).&rdquo; And the thought thrilled his body and delighted his heart.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>baṃdi carana ura dhari prabhutāī. aṃgada calēu sabahi siru nāī..</h5> <h5>prabhu pratāpa ura sahaja asaṃkā. rana bāomkurā bālisuta baṃkā..

[6-17(B)-5]</h5> <p>Adoring the Lord&rsquo;s feet and keeping His glory in his heart Aṅgada bowed his head to all and departed. The gallant son of Vāli, who was an adept in warfare, was dauntless by nature, cherishing as he did the might of the Lord. As soon as he entered the city he met one of Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s sons (Prahasta by name), who was playing there. From words they proceeded to fight; for both were unrivalled in strength and in the prime of youth to boot. He raised his foot to kick Aṅgada, who in his turn seized the foot and, swinging him round, dashed him to the ground finding him a formidable warrior, the demons ran helterskelter in large numbers, too much frightened to raise an alarm. They did not tell one another what had happened, but kept quiet when they thought of the death of Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s son. There was a cry in the whole city that the same monkey who had burnt down Laṅkā had come again. &ldquo;Who knows what turn Providence is going to take?&rdquo; everyone thought in excessive dismay. People showed him the way unasked: if he but looked at anyone, the latter would turn deadly pale.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>gayau sabhā darabāra taba sumiri rāma pada kaṃja.</h5> <h5>siṃha ṭhavani ita uta citava dhīra bīra bala puṃja..18.. [6-18]</h5> <p>With his thoughts fixed on the lotus-feet of Śrī Rāma he then reached the gate of Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s council-chamber. And there the stout-hearted and mighty hero stood with the mien of a lion glancing this side and that.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>turata nisācara ēka paṭhāvā. samācāra rāvanahi janāvā..</h5> <h5>sunata bihaomsi bōlā dasasīsā. ānahu bōli kahāom kara kīsā..

[6-18-4]</h5> <p>He forthwith sent a demon and apprised Rāvaṇa of his arrival. On hearing the news the ten-headed monster laughed and said. &ldquo;Go, usher him in my presence and let me see where the monkey has come from.&rdquo; Receiving his order a host of messengers ran and fetched the monkey chief. Aṅgada saw the ten-headed giant seated on his throne like a living mountain of collyrium. His arms looked like trees and heads like peaks; while the hair on his body presented the appearance of numerous creepers. His mouths, nostrils, eyes and ears were as big as mountain caves and chasms. With an unflinching mind he entered the court, the valiant son of Vāli, possessed of great might. The assembly abruptly rose at the sight of the monkey; at this Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s heart was filled with great fury</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jathā matta gaja jūtha mahu paṃcānana cali jāi.</h5> <h5>rāma pratāpa sumiri mana baiṭha sabhāom siru nāi..19.. [6-19]</h5> <p>Thinking of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s might Aṅgada bowed his head and took his seat in the assembly as fearlessly as a lion treads in the midst of mad elephants.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kaha dasakaṃṭha kavana taiṃ baṃdara. maiṃ raghubīra dūta dasakaṃdhara..</h5> <h5>mama janakahi tōhi rahī mitāī. tava hita kārana āyau bhāī..

[6-19-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Monkey, who are you?&rdquo; Rāvaṇa asked. &ldquo;I am an ambassador from the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line, Rāvaṇa. There was friendship between you and my father; hence it is in your interest, brother, that I have come. Of noble descent and a grandson of the sage Pulastya (one of the mind-born sons of Brahma), you worshipped Lord Śiva and Brahma in various ways, obtained boons from them, accomplished all your objects and conquered the guardians of the different spheres as well as all earthly sovereigns. Under the influence of kingly pride or infatuation you carried off Sītā, the Mother of the Universe. But even now you listen to my friendly advice and the Lord will forgive all your offences. Put a straw between the rows of your teeth and an axe by your throat and take all your people including your wives with you, respectfully placing Janaka&rsquo;s Daughter at the head. In this way repair to Him shedding all fear.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>pranatapāla raghubaṃsamani trāhi trāhi aba mōhi.</h5> <h5>ārata girā sunata prabhu abhaya karaigō tōhi..20.. [6-20]</h5> <p>&ldquo;And address Him thus: &lsquo;O Protector of the suppliant, O Jewel of Raghu&rsquo;s race, save me, save me now.&rsquo; The moment He hears your piteous cry the Lord will surely rid you of every fear.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>rē kapipōta bōlu saṃbhārī. mūḍha na jānēhi mōhi surārī..</h5> <h5>kahu nija nāma janaka kara bhāī. kēhi nātēṃ māniai mitāī..

[6-20-5]</h5> <p>Mind what you speak, you little monkey. Fool, are you not aware of my being an avowed enemy of the gods? Tell me, young fellow, your own name as well as your father&rsquo;s. What is the common ground on which you claim fellowship between your father and myself?&rdquo; &ldquo;Aṅgada is my name: I am Vāli&rsquo;s son. Did you ever meet him?&rdquo; Rāvaṇa felt uncomfortable when he heard Aṅgada&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Yes, I do remember that there was a monkey, Vāli by name. But, Aṅgada, are you Vāli&rsquo;s son? You have been born as a fire in a cluster of bamboos for the destruction of your own race. Why should you have not perished even in the womb? In vain were you born, who have called yourself with your own mouth a hermit&rsquo;s envoy. Now tell me if all is well with Vāli and, if so, where is he?&rdquo; Aṅgada laughed at this and then replied. &ldquo;Ten days hence you shall go to Vāli and embracing your friend personally enquire after his welfare. He will tell you all about the welfare that follows from hostility with Śrī Rāma. Listen, O fool: the seeds of dissension can be sown in the mind of him alone whose heart is closed to the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>hama kula ghālaka satya tumha kula pālaka dasasīsa.</h5> <h5>aṃdhau badhira na asa kahahiṃ nayana kāna tava bīsa..21. [6-21]</h5> <p>I, forsooth, am the exterminator of my race; while you, Rāvaṇa, are the preserver of yours. Even the blind and the deaf would not say so, whereas you possess a score of eyes and an equal number of ears.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>siva biraṃci sura muni samudāī. cāhata jāsu carana sēvakāī..</h5> <h5>tāsu dūta hōi hama kula bōrā. aisihu mati ura bihara na tōrā..

Did I bring dishonour on my family by acting as His ambassador whose feet even Śiva, Brahma and all the gods and sages desire to serve? It is strange that your heart does not burst asunder even on entertaining such an idea.&rdquo; When he heard the monkey&rsquo;s sharp rejoinder, Rāvaṇa glowered at him and said, &ldquo;Wretch, I put up with your harsh words only because I know the bounds of decorum and righteousness.&rdquo; Said the monkey, &ldquo;I too have heard of your piety, which is evident from the fact that you stole away another&rsquo;s wife. And I have witnessed with my own eyes the protection you vouchsafed to an envoy. An upholder of piety, why do you not drown yourself and thus end your life? When you saw your sister with her ears and nose cut off, it was from considerations of piety that you forgave the wrong. Your piety is famed throughout the world: I too am very fortunate in having been able to see you.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jani jalpasi jaḍa jaṃtu kapi saṭha bilōku mama bāhu.</h5> <h5>lōkapāla bala bipula sasi grasana hētu saba rāhu..22ka..

Mount Kailāsa with Śambhu (Lord Śiva) shone like a swan.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>tumharē kaṭaka mājha sunu aṃgada. mō sana bhirihi kavana jōdhā bada..</h5> <h5>tava prabhu nāri birahaom balahīnā. anuja tāsu dukha dukhī malīnā..

[6-22(B)-5]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Listen, Aṅgada; tell me which warrior in your army will dare encounter me. Your master (Rāma) has grown weak due to separation from his wife, while his younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) shares his grief and is consequently very sad. You and Sugrīva are like trees on a river bank (that can be washed away any moment); as for my younger brother (Vibhīṣaṇa), he is a great coward. Your counsellor, Jāmbavān, is too advanced in age to take his stand on the field of battle; while Nala and Nīla are mere architects (and no warriors). There is one monkey, no doubt, of extraordinary might-he who came before and set fire to the city.&rdquo; On hearing this Vāli&rsquo;s son (Aṅgada) replied: &ldquo;Tell me the truth, O demon king: is it a fact that a monkey burnt down your capital? A puny monkey set on fire Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s capital ! Who, on hearing such a report, would declare it as true? Rāvaṇa, he whom you have extolled as a distinguished warrior is only one of Sugrīva&rsquo;s petty runners. He who walks long distances is no champion; we sent him only to get news.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>satya nagaru kapi jārēu binu prabhu āyasu pāi.</h5> <h5>phiri na gayau sugrīva pahiṃ tēhiṃ bhaya rahā lukāi..23ka..

[6-23(F)]</h5> <p>&ldquo;It seems true that the monkey set fire to your capital without receiving an order from his master. That is why he did not go back to Sugrīva and remained in hiding for fear. All that you say, Rāvaṇa, is true and I am not in the least angry at hearing it. There is none in our army who would fight you with any amount of grace. Make friends or enter into hostilities only with your equals: this is a sound maxim to follow. If a lion were to kill frogs, will anyone speak well of him? Though it would be derogatory on the part of Śrī Rāma to kill you and He will incur great blame thereby, yet, mark me, Rāvaṇa, the fury of the Kṣatriya race is hard to face.&rdquo; The monkey (Aṅgada) burnt the enemy&rsquo;s heart with shafts of speech shot forth from the bow of sarcasm; and the ten-headed hero proceeded to extract the arrows, so to speak, with pairs of pincers in the form of rejoinders. He laughed and said: &ldquo;A monkey possesses one great virtue: it does everything in its power to serve him who maintains it.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>dhanya kīsa jō nija prabhu kājā. jahaom tahaom nācai parihari lājā..</h5> <h5>nāci kūdi kari lōga rijhāī. pati hita karai dharma nipunāī..

[6-23(F)-8]</h5> <p>Bravo for a monkey, who dances unabashed in the service of its master anywhere and everywhere. Dancing and skipping about to amuse the people it serves the interest of its master; this shows its keen devotion to duty. Aṅgada, all of your race are devoted to their lord; how could you, then, fail to extol the virtues of your master in the way you have done? I am a respecter of merit and too magnanimous to pay any attention to your scurrilously glib talk.&rdquo; Said Aṅgada: &ldquo;The son of the wind-god gave me a true account of your partiality to merit. He laid waste your garden, killed your son and set fire to your city and yet (in your eyes) he did you no wrong.

Knowing you to be a living memorial of Vāli&rsquo;s unsullied fame, I desist from killing you, O vile boaster. Tell me, Rāvaṇa, how many Ravanas there are in the world? Or hear from me how many I have heard of. One went to the nether world (Pātāla) to conquer Bali and was tied up in the stables by the children, who made sport of him and thrashed him till Bali took compassion on him and had him released. Another again was discovered by King Sahasrabāhu, who ran and captured him as a strange creature and brought him home for the sake of fun. The sage Pulastya then went and secured his release.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ēka kahata mōhi sakuca ati rahā bāli kī kāomkha.</h5> <h5>inha mahu rāvana taiṃ kavana satya badahi taji mākha..24..

Aṅgada (the great monkey) gave a loud yell and furiously struck both his mighty arms against the ground.

Or is it that Rāvaṇa in his fury has hurled four thunderbolts, which are coming with great speed ?&rdquo; The Lord smiled and said, &ldquo;Be not afraid at heart.

The enemy&rsquo;s pride left him when he witnessed this.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kapi bala dēkhi sakala hiyaom hārē. uṭhā āpu kapi kēṃ paracārē..</h5> <h5>gahata carana kaha bālikumārā. mama pada gahēṃ na tōra ubārā..

Challenged by the monkey Rāvaṇa himself now rose. Even as Rāvaṇa proceeded to grasp his foot, Vāli&rsquo;s son (Aṅgada) broke out, &ldquo;You cannot be saved by clinging to my feet. Fool, why do you not go and clasp Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet ?&rdquo; He turned back much abashed at heart to hear this. All his splendour was gone and he was robbed of his glory even as the moon fades away at midday. With drooping heads he resumed his seat on the throne as if despoiled of all his riches. Śrī Rāma is the soul of the universe and the lord of life : how can he who is hostile to Him find any rest ? The universe, Umā (Pārvatī), springs into existence and is again dissolved with a mere play of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s eyebrows. When He is capable of transforming a blade of grass into a thunderbolt and a thunderbolt into a blade of grass, how, then, can a vow of His ambassador prove false ? Aṅgada admonished him in various ways; but as his end had drawn near, he would not listen. Having squashed the enemy&rsquo;s pride, the son of King Vāli glorified his lord to his very face and departed, saying : &ldquo;If I do not slay you after I have sported with you on the battlefield for some time, it will be no use my indulging in self-praise just now.&rdquo; Aṅgada had killed Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s son even before he arrived in the latter&rsquo;s presence and Rāvaṇa felt very sad at the news. The demons too grew particularly nervous with fear when they witnessed the effectiveness of Aṅgada&rsquo;s challenge.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ripu bala dharaṣi haraṣi kapi bālitanaya bala puṃja.</h5> <h5>pulaka sarīra nayana jala gahē rāma pada kaṃja..35ka..

[6-35(B)]</h5> <p>Setting at naught Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s power, the mighty monkey, Vāli&rsquo;s son, his body thrilling over with emotion and eyes full of tears, clasped in delight Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s lotus feet. Perceiving that it was evening, the ten-headed monster returned disconsolately to his palace, where Mandodarī again spoke and advised him:-</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-5 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/6/7" > Previous (Part - 7) </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/6/9" > Next (Part - 9) </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/6"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>6 - Laṅkā Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/6/8"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part - 8</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-title> Select language </swal-title> <swal-input type=select  value=hi  /> <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/language-selector.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
