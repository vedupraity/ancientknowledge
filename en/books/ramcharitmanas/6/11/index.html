[6-39]</h5> <p>Glory to Rāma, glory to Lakṣmaṇa and glory to Sugrīva (the lord of the monkeys), thus roared the monkeys and bears, unsurpassed in their great might, like so many lions.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>laṃkāom bhayau kōlāhala bhārī. sunā dasānana ati ahaomkārī..</h5> <h5>dēkhahu banaranha kēri ḍhiṭhāī. bihaomsi nisācara sēna bōlāī..

[6-39-5]</h5> <p>Laṅkā became a scene of great uproar. When the highly conceited Rāvaṇa heard it, he with a smile said, &ldquo;Look at the insolence of these monkeys!&rdquo; and summoned the demon host. &ldquo;The monkeys have crossed over here driven by fate, and my demons are all hungry. God has provided them with a meal even at their home.&rdquo; So saying the idiot burst into a horselaugh. &ldquo;Sally forth in every direction, champions all; and wherever you find the bears and monkeys seize and devour them all.&rdquo; Umā, Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s conceit was as great as that of the sandpiper, which goes to sleep with its legs in the air (and thinks that it will support the heavens in case they fall). Taking his orders, the demons sallied forth, armed with excellent slings, javelins, iron clubs and maces, fierce axes, pikes, swords, bludgeons and masses of rock in their hands. As foolish carnivorous birds swoop down upon a heap of rubies the moment they see it, and have no idea of the pain they would have on breaking their beaks against it, so did the man-eating monsters rush forth in their folly.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>nānāyudha sara cāpa dhara jātudhāna bala bīra.</h5> <h5>kōṭa kaomgūranhi caḍhai gaē kōṭi kōṭi ranadhīra..40.. [6-40]</h5> <p>Armed with bows and arrows as well as with other weapons of various kinds, a vast cloud of mighty and valiant demons, staunch in battle, climbed up the battlements of the fort.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kōṭa kaomgūranhi sōhahiṃ kaisē. mēru kē sṛṃgani janu ghana baisē..</h5> <h5>bājahiṃ ḍhōla nisāna jujhāū. suni dhuni hōi bhaṭanhi mana cāū..

[6-40-4]</h5> <p>On the gold battlements they looked like dark clouds hanging on the heights of Mount Meru. Martial drums and tabors sounded; the soul of the warriors was stirred by their crash. Numberless kettledrums and clarionets were also playing; their music cracked the heart of cowards. Advancing further, the demons saw the hosts of monkey and bear champions, exceptionally huge in size, who in their onrush would make no account of rugged valleys and catching hold of mountains would cleave them asunder and make passage through them. Gnashing their teeth and biting their lips, myriads of warriors on both sides roared and bullied, calling here on Rāma and there on Rāvaṇa. With shouts of victory on both sides the fight actually commenced. The demons cast down volleys of mountain-peaks, which the monkeys would seize with a bound and hurl them back.</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>dhari kudhara khaṃḍa pracaṃḍa karkaṭa bhālu gaḍha para ḍārahīṃ.</h5> <h5>jhapaṭahiṃ carana gahi paṭaki mahi bhaji calata bahuri pacārahīṃ..</h5> <h5>ati tarala taruna pratāpa tarapahiṃ tamaki gaḍha caḍhai caḍhai gaē.</h5> <h5>kapi bhālu caḍhai maṃdiranha jahaom tahaom rāma jasu gāvata bhaē..</h5> <p>The fierce monkeys and bears would lay hold of masses of rock and hurl them against the fort. Darting against their adversary they would seize him by the leg and dash him to the ground; and in the event of his taking to flight they would challenge him to a duel again. The most agile and redoubtable monkeys and bears lightly sprang and climbed up the fort and penetrating the palaces sang Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s praises wherever they pleased.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ēku ēku nisicara gahi puni kapi calē parāi.</h5> <h5>ūpara āpu hēṭha bhaṭa girahiṃ dharani para āi..41.. [6-41]</h5> <p>Catching hold of a demon each the monkeys rushed back and jumped down to the ground with the demons beneath themselves on the top.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>rāma pratāpa prabala kapijūthā. mardahiṃ nisicara subhaṭa barūthā..</h5> <h5>caḍhaē durga puni jahaom tahaom bānara. jaya raghubīra pratāpa divākara..

[6-41-5]</h5> <p>Strengthened by Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s might, the monkey host crushed the ranks of the demon warriors. They then climbed up the fort here and there and shouted glory to the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line, who was majestic as the sun. The demon host fled before them like a mass of clouds driven by a strong blast. The city now burst into wails and howls; children, invalids and women in particular wept aloud. All joined in calling Rāvaṇa names; he, they said, had invited death while enjoying sovereignty. When he heard that his troops had beaten a retreat, the king of Laṅkā rallied his champions and then exclaimed in fury: &ldquo;If I hear of anyone turning his back on the battlefield, I will behead him with my own terrible sword. You consumed my all and enjoyed all sorts of luxuries till now and lo ! life has become so dear to you on the field of battle.&rdquo; The champions were all alarmed and put to shame to hear this stern rebuke, and marched against the enemy in great fury. To die in open combat is the glory of a warrior, they thought; and they loved their life no more.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bahu āyudha dhara subhaṭa saba bhirahiṃ pacāri pacāri.</h5> <h5>byākula kiē bhālu kapi parigha trisūlanhi mārī..42.. [6-42]</h5> <p>Armed with weapons of various kinds, all the champions grappled with their antagonists, challenging them again and again. Striking the bears and monkeys with iron bludgeons and tridents, they deprived them of their nerve.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhaya ātura kapi bhāgana lāgē. jadyapi umā jītihahiṃ āgē..</h5> <h5>kōu kaha kahaom aṃgada hanumaṃtā. kahaom nala nīla dubida balavaṃtā..

[6-42-4]</h5> <p>Struck with terror (continues Lord Śiva) the monkeys turned tail, although Umā, they would come out victorious in the end. One exclaimed, &ldquo;Where are Aṅgada and Hanumān? Where are the mighty Nala, Nīla and Dvivida?&rdquo; At the time Hanumān heard that his troops were breaking, that mighty warrior held his position at the western gate of Laṅkā, where Meghanāda led the defence. The gate, however, would not give way and Hanumān was faced with a mighty impediment. The son of the wind-god grew terribly furious at heart and the warrior, who was formidable as death, gave a loud roar. He sprang and reached the fort of Laṅkā; and seizing a rock he rushed at Meghanāda, shattered his chariot, overthrew the charioteer and kicked Meghanāda himself at his chest. Another charioteer, who perceived the distress of the prince, picked him up in his own chariot and speedily brought him home.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>aṃgada sunā pavanasuta gaḍha para gayau akēla.</h5> <h5>rana bāomkurā bālisuta taraki caḍhaēu kapi khēla..43.. [6-43]</h5> <p>When Aṅgada heard that the son of the wind-god had gone to the fort singlehanded, the son of Vāli, who was so valiant in battle, reached the fort in a single bound as a monkey would do out of sheer fun.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>juddha biruddha kruddha dvau baṃdara. rāma pratāpa sumiri ura aṃtara..</h5> <h5>rāvana bhavana caḍhaē dvau dhāī. karahi kōsalādhīsa dōhāī.. [6-43-1]</h5> <h5>kalasa sahita gahi bhavanu ḍhahāvā. dēkhi nisācarapati bhaya pāvā..</h5> <h5>nāri bṛṃda kara pīṭahiṃ chātī. aba dui kapi āē utapātī..

[6-43-4]</h5> <p>The two monkeys let loose their fury against the enemy on the battlefield. Invoking in their heart the might of Śrī Rāma, both ran up to Rāvaṇa&rsquo;s own palace and proclaimed the victory of Kosala&rsquo;s lord. Holding the edifice in their hands they overthrew it with every pinnacle. The demon king was dismayed when he saw this. The women beat their breast with their hands crying: &ldquo;This time the two pestilent monkeys have come!&rdquo; Aṅgada and Hanumān frightened them with their monkey-like pranks and proclaimed to them the glories of Śrī Rāmacandra. Then, grasping each a gold pillar in their hands, the two champions exclaimed, &ldquo;Let us now begin upon our ravaging job!&rdquo; Presently they roared and fell on the enemy&rsquo;s ranks and began to crush them with their mighty strength of arms, striking some with their foot and slapping another on the face and crying: &ldquo;Take the consequences of not adoring Śrī Rāma!&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ēka ēka sōṃ mardahiṃ tōri calāvahiṃ muṃḍa.</h5> <h5>rāvana āgēṃ parahiṃ tē janu phūṭahiṃ dadhi kuṃḍa..44.. [6-44]</h5> <p>The two heroes crushed their adversaries one against another and pulling off the victim&rsquo;s heads, hurled them with such precision that they dropped in front of Rāvaṇa and burst like so many earthen vases full of curds.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>mahā mahā mukhiā jē pāvahiṃ. tē pada gahi prabhu pāsa calāvahiṃ..</h5> <h5>kahai bibhīṣanu tinha kē nāmā. dēhiṃ rāma tinhahū nija dhāmā..

[6-44-4]</h5> <p>host, they would seize him by the leg and send him flying to their lord (Śrī Rāma). Vibhīṣaṇa would mention their name and Śrī Rāma assigned even them a quarter in His own abode. Man-eating monsters who feasted on the flesh of holy Brāhmaṇas thus attained a destiny which is solicited even by Yogīs (ascetics given to contemplation on God). Umā, (continues Lord Śiva,) Śrī Rāma is so tender-hearted and such a storehouse of compassion that He bestows the highest state (final beatitude) even on the demons, remembering that they think of Him even though in a spirit of hostility! Tell me, Bhavānī, who else is so benignant? Most dull-witted and utterly wretched are the men who, even on hearing of such a lord, worship Him not, disabusing themselves of all delusion. &ldquo;Aṅgada and Hanumān have evidently forced their way into the fort of Laṅkā,&rdquo; thus observed Ayodhyā&rsquo;s lord. Rampaging in Laṅkā, the two monkeys looked like a pair of Mandaras churning the ocean.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhuja bala ripu dala dalamali dēkhi divasa kara aṃta.</h5> <h5>kūdē jugala bigata śrama āē jahaom bhagavaṃta..45.. [6-45]</h5> <p>Having crushed and battered the enemy&rsquo;s ranks by the might of their arm and perceiving that it was now the close of day, the two champions jumped down without any exertion and came where the Lord was.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>prabhu pada kamala sīsa tinha nāē. dēkhi subhaṭa raghupati mana bhāē..</h5> <h5>rāma kṛpā kari jugala nihārē. bhaē bigataśrama parama sukhārē..

[6-45-5]</h5> <h5>bhayau nimiṣa mahaom ati aomdhiyārā. bṛṣṭi hōi rudhirōpala chārā.. [6-45-6]</h5> <p>They bowed their head at the lotus-feet of their Master, and the Lord of the Raghus was glad at heart to see the valiant warriors. Śrī Rāma graciously regarded them both and presently their fatigue was gone and they felt supremely happy. On learning that Aṅgada and Hanumān had left, the numerous monkey and bear warriors retired from the field; while the demons, recovering their strength at nightfall, sallied forth, calling on their ten-headed lord. At the sight of the demon host the monkeys turned again; and gnashing their teeth in fury the champions closed with their opponents here and there. The two armies stood formidable; their champion&rsquo;s challenging one another every time, came to a grim fight without giving in. The demons were all great warriors and dark in complexion; while the monkeys were stupendous in size and of numerous colours. The two armies were equally strong and the warriors too equally matched; displaying their martial feats they fought with fury and looked like masses of rainy and autumnal clouds driven against one another by a strong wind. The generals Akampana and Atikāya (sons of Rāvaṇa), when they perceived their troops losing ground, employed Māyā (illusive devices); in an instant it grew pitch dark and there was a downpour of blood, stone and ashes.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>dēkhi nibiḍa tama dasahu disi kapidala bhayau khabhāra.</h5> <h5>ēkahi ēka na dēkhaī jahaom tahaom karahiṃ pukāra..46.. [6-46]</h5> <p>Seeing the dense darkness all round, the monkey host was thrown into disorder. They could not see one another and there was an outcry everywhere.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sakala maramu raghunāyaka jānā. liē bōli aṃgada hanumānā..</h5> <h5>samācāra saba kahi samujhāē. sunata kōpi kapikuṃjara dhāē.. [6-46-1]</h5> <h5>puni kṛpāla haomsi cāpa caḍhaāvā. pāvaka sāyaka sapadi calāvā..</h5> <h5>bhayau prakāsa katahu tama nāhīṃ. gyāna udayaom jimi saṃsaya jāhīṃ..

[6-46-4]</h5> <p>The Lord of the Raghus understood the secret of it all and summoned Aṅgada and Hanumān. He apprised them of all that was going on and issued necessary instructions to them. The two monkey chiefs rushed forth in a fury as soon as they heard the instructions. The All-merciful then drew His bow with a smile and forthwith let fly a flery dart. Lo! there was light all round and no trace of darkness left anywhere, even as doubts disappear with the dawn of spiritual enlightenment. The bear and monkeys were relieved of their fatigue and rid of all fear when they saw light again, and pressed on exultingly. Hanumān and Aṅgada thundered on the field of battle and the demons fled at their menacing roar.
