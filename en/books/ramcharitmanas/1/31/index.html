Nārada&rsquo;s pronouncing a curse on the attendants of Śiva as well as on the Lord Himself and his subsequent freedom from the spell of infatuation</h4> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>āni dēkhāī nāradahi bhūpati rājakumāri.</h5> <h5>kahahu nātha guna dōṣa saba ēhi kē hṛdayaom bicāri..130.. [1-130]</h5> <p>The king brought and showed the princess to Nārada and said, &ldquo;Tell me after mature thought all that is good or bad about her.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>dēkhi rūpa muni birati bisārī. baḍaī bāra lagi rahē nihārī..</h5> <h5>lacchana tāsu bilōki bhulānē. hṛdayaom haraṣa nahiṃ pragaṭa bakhānē.. [1-130-1]</h5> <h5>jō ēhi barai amara sōi hōī. samarabhūmi tēhi jīta na kōī..</h5> <h5>sēvahiṃ sakala carācara tāhī. barai sīlanidhi kanyā jāhī.. [1-130-2]</h5> <h5>lacchana saba bicāri ura rākhē. kachuka banāi bhūpa sana bhāṣē..</h5> <h5>sutā sulacchana kahi nṛpa pāhīṃ. nārada calē sōca mana māhīṃ..

[1-130-4]</h5> <p>Seeing her beauty the sage forgot all about his dispassion and remained gazing on her for a long time. When he read the auspicious marks on her body, he was lost in reverie. He was gladdened at heart, but he would not openly mention the happy characteristics. &ldquo;He who weds this girl,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;Shall become immortal; and no one shall be able to conquer him in battle. He whom Śīlanidhi&rsquo;s daughter selects for her lord shall be adored by the entire creation, both animate and inanimate.&rdquo; Having read these characteristics the sage kept them to himself, and mentioned a few fabricated ones to the king. Telling the king that his daughter was of good promise, Nārada left. He thought within himself, &ldquo;Let me devise and try some means whereby the princess may choose me for her husband.&rdquo; He had no more zeal to practise Japa (muttering of sacred formulas) or austerity. &ldquo;Good God, how am I to get the girl?&rdquo; he said to himself.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ēhi avasara cāhia parama sōbhā rūpa bisāla.</h5> <h5>jō bilōki rījhai kuaomri taba mēlai jayamāla..131.. [1-131]</h5> <p>&ldquo;What is needed on this occasion is great personal charm and surpassing beauty, whereby the princess may be enamoured of me and place the wreath of victory round my neck,&rdquo; he continued.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>hari sana māgauṃ suṃdaratāī. hōihi jāta gaharu ati bhāī..</h5> <h5>mōrēṃ hita hari sama nahiṃ kōū. ēhi avasara sahāya sōi hōū.. [1-131-1]</h5> <h5>bahubidhi binaya kīnhi tēhi kālā. pragaṭēu prabhu kautukī kṛpālā..</h5> <h5>prabhu bilōki muni nayana juḍaānē. hōihi kāju hiēom haraṣānē.. [1-131-2]</h5> <h5>ati ārati kahi kathā sunāī. karahu kṛpā kari hōhu sahāī..</h5> <h5>āpana rūpa dēhu prabhu mōhī. āna bhāomti nahiṃ pāvauṃ ōhī.. [1-131-3]</h5> <h5>jēhi bidhi nātha hōi hita mōrā. karahu sō bēgi dāsa maiṃ tōrā..</h5> <h5>nija māyā bala dēkhi bisālā. hiyaom haomsi bōlē dīnadayālā.. [1-131-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Let me ask Hari for a gift of beauty. But, alas! much time will be lost in going to Him. Yet I have no such friend as Hari; let Him, therefore, come to my rescue at this juncture.&rdquo; Then Nārada prayed in manifold ways and lo! The sportive and merciful Lord appeared before him. The sight was soothing to the sage&rsquo;s eyes. He was glad at heart and felt assured that his object would be accomplished. In great humility he told the Lord all that had happened, and said, &ldquo;Be gracious to me and be good enough to help me. Lord, bestow on me Your own beauty; in no other way can I get possession of her. Speedily do that which may serve my best interests; I am Your own servant, my lord.&rdquo; Seeing the mighty power of His Māyā, the Lord, who is compassionate to the poor, smiled to himself and said</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jēhi bidhi hōihi parama hita nārada sunahu tumhāra.</h5> <h5>sōi hama karaba na āna kachu bacana na mṛṣā hamāra..132.. [1-132]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Nārada, listen to me; I shall do that alone which is good to you, and nothing else My words can never be untrue.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kupatha māga ruja byākula rōgī. baida na dēi sunahu muni jōgī..</h5> <h5>ēhi bidhi hita tumhāra maiṃ ṭhayaū. kahi asa aṃtarahita prabhu bhayaū.. [1-132-1]</h5> <h5>māyā bibasa bhaē muni mūḍhaā. samujhī nahiṃ hari girā nigūḍhaā..</h5> <h5>gavanē turata tahāom riṣirāī. jahāom svayaṃbara bhūmi banāī.. [1-132-2]</h5> <h5>nija nija āsana baiṭhē rājā. bahu banāva kari sahita samājā..</h5> <h5>muni mana haraṣa rūpa ati mōrēṃ. mōhi taji ānahi bārihi na bhōrēṃ.. [1-132-3]</h5> <h5>muni hita kārana kṛpānidhānā. dīnha kurūpa na jāi bakhānā..</h5> <h5>sō caritra lakhi kāhu na pāvā. nārada jāni sabahiṃ sira nāvā.. [1-132-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Hark, O contemplative ascetic! if a patient distracted by his malady asks for something which is harmful to him, the physician would not give it. In a like manner I have resolved on doing what is good to you.&rdquo; So saying, the Lord disappeared. Under the spell of His Māyā the sage was so mystified that he could not understand even such unambiguous words of Śrī Hari. The chief of seers hastened to the spot where the arena for the choice-marriage had been prepared. Richly adorned, the royal suitors had occupied their respective seats, each with his retinue. The sage was glad at heart; for he thought within himself, &ldquo;My beauty is so surpassing that the princess will never commit the error of choosing for her husband anyone else than me.&rdquo; In the sage&rsquo;s own interest the gracious Lord had made him hideous beyond description. But no one could mark the change that had taken place in him; everyone knew him to be Nārada and greeted him as such.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>rahē tahāom dui rudra gana tē jānahiṃ saba bhēu.</h5> <h5>biprabēṣa dēkhata phirahiṃ parama kautukī tēu..133.. [1-133]</h5> <p>Two of Śiva attendants too happened to be there. They knew the whole secret and, disguised as Brāhmaṇas, went about seeing the fun.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>jēṃhi samāja baiṃṭhē muni jāī. hṛdayaom rūpa ahamiti adhikāī..</h5> <h5>tahaom baiṭha mahēsa gana dōū. biprabēṣa gati lakhai na kōū.. [1-133-1]</h5> <h5>karahiṃ kūṭi nāradahi sunāī. nīki dīnhi hari suṃdaratāī..</h5> <h5>rījhahi rājakuaomri chabi dēkhī. inhahi barihi hari jāni bisēṣī.. [1-133-2]</h5> <h5>munihi mōha mana hātha parāēom. haomsahiṃ saṃbhu gana ati sacu pāēom..</h5> <h5>jadapi sunahiṃ muni aṭapaṭi bānī. samujhi na parai buddhi bhrama sānī.. [1-133-3]</h5> <h5>kāhu na lakhā sō carita bisēṣā. sō sarūpa nṛpakanyāom dēkhā..</h5> <h5>markaṭa badana bhayaṃkara dēhī. dēkhata hṛdayaom krōdha bhā tēhī.. [1-133-4]</h5> <p>In the row where sat Nārada, exceedingly proud of his beauty, the two attendants of Mahesa too seated themselves. Being disguised as Brāhmaṇas they could not be detected. They flung sarcastic remarks at Nārada, saying, &ldquo;Hari has given this man such excellent beauty that the princess will be enamoured to look at it and shall certainly choose him, taking him for Hari* Himself.&rdquo; The sage was under a spell of delusion; for his heart had been stolen by love. The attendants of Śiva felt amused at this and greatly enjoyed the fun. Even though the sage heard their ironical talk, he could not follow it, his reason being clouded by infatuation. No one perceived this extra-ordinary phenomenon; the princess alone saw his ugly form. The moment she beheld his monkey-like face and frightful form she was filled with rage</p> <ul> <li><strong>*</strong> The word &lsquo;Hari&rsquo; also means a monkey: the attendants of Śiva, therefore, indirectly hinted that the sage looked like a monkey. </ul> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sakhīṃ saṃga lai kuaomri taba cali janu rājamarāla.</h5> <h5>dēkhata phirai mahīpa saba kara sarōja jayamāla..134.. [1-134]</h5> <p>Accompained by her girl companions the princess then glided as a swan. With a wreath of victory in her lotus hands she moved about surveying each of her royal suitors.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>jēhi disi baiṭhē nārada phūlī. sō disi dēhi na bilōkī bhūlī..</h5> <h5>puni puni muni ukasahiṃ akulāhīṃ. dēkhi dasā hara gana musakāhīṃ.. [1-134-1]</h5> <h5>dhari nṛpatanu tahaom gayau kṛpālā. kuaomri haraṣi mēlēu jayamālā..</h5> <h5>dulahini lai gē lacchinivāsā. nṛpasamāja saba bhayau nirāsā.. [1-134-2]</h5> <h5>muni ati bikala mōṃhaom mati nāṭhī. mani giri gaī chūṭi janu gāomṭhī..</h5> <h5>taba hara gana bōlē musukāī. nija mukha mukura bilōkahu jāī.. [1-134-3]</h5> <h5>asa kahi dōu bhāgē bhayaom bhārī. badana dīkha muni bāri nihārī..</h5> <h5>bēṣu bilōki krōdha ati bāḍhaā. tinhahi sarāpa dīnha ati gāḍhaā.. [1-134-4]</h5> <p>She did not care to look even casually at the quarter in which Nārada sat elated with pride. Again and again the sage would raise himself and fidget about; the attendants of Hara smiled to see him in that state. The gracious Lord too went there in the form of a king; the princess joyfully placed the wreath of victory round His neck. The Lord of Lakṣmī carried off the bride to the despair of all assembled kings. The sage felt much perturbed; for infatuation had robbed the sage of his reason. He felt as if a gem had dropped from a loosened knot in the end of his garment. The attendants of Hara then smilingly said, &ldquo;Just look at your face in a mirror.&rdquo; Uttering these words both ran away in great alarm and the sage looked at his reflection in water. His fury knew no bounds when he beheld his form; and he pronounced a terrible curse on the attendants of Śiva</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>hōhu nisācara jāi tumha kapaṭī pāpī dōu.</h5> <h5>haomsēhu hamahi sō lēhu phala bahuri haomsēhu muni kōu..135.. [1-135]</h5> <p>&ldquo;O you sinful impostors, go and be reborn as demons. You mocked me; therefore, reap its reward. Mock again a sage, if you dare</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>puni jala dīkha rūpa nija pāvā. tadapi hṛdayaom saṃtōṣa na āvā..</h5> <h5>pharakata adhara kōpa mana māhīṃ. sapadī calē kamalāpati pāhīṃ.. [1-135-1]</h5> <h5>dēhau śrāpa ki marihau jāī. jagata mōra upahāsa karāī..</h5> <h5>bīcahiṃ paṃtha milē danujārī. saṃga ramā sōi rājakumārī.. [1-135-2]</h5> <h5>bōlē madhura bacana surasāīṃ. muni kahaom calē bikala kī nāīṃ..</h5> <h5>sunata bacana upajā ati krōdhā. māyā basa na rahā mana bōdhā.. [1-135-3]</h5> <h5>para saṃpadā sakahu nahiṃ dēkhī. tumharēṃ iriṣā kapaṭa bisēṣī..</h5> <h5>mathata siṃdhu rudrahi baurāyahu. suranha prērī biṣa pāna karāyahu.. [1-135-4]</h5> <p>Looking again in water, he saw that he had regained his real form; yet his heart found no solace. His lips quivered and there was indignation in his heart. At once he proceeded to where the Lord of Lakṣmī was. &ldquo;I shall either curse Him or die at His door,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;seeing that He has made me a butt of ridicule throughout the world.&rdquo; The terror of the demons, Śrī Hari, met him right on the way. He was accompanied by Goddess Rāma and the princess referred to above. The lord of immortals spoke in gentle tones, &ldquo;To what destination, holy sir, are you betaking yourself like one distracted?&rdquo; As soon as he heard these words Nārada was filled with rage. Dominated as he was by Māyā, there was no reason left in him. He said, &ldquo;You cannot bear to look upon the good fortune of others. You are richly endowed with jealousy and fraud. While churning the ocean You drove Rudra mad and inciting Him through the gods You made Him quaff the poison.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>asura surā biṣa saṃkarahi āpu ramā mani cāru.</h5> <h5>svāratha sādhaka kuṭila tumha sadā kapaṭa byavahāru..136.. [1-136]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Apportioning intoxicating liquor to the demons and poison to Śaṅkara, You appropriated Rāma and the lovely gem (Kaustubha) to Yourself. You have ever been selfish and perverse, and treacherous in Your dealings.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>parama svataṃtra na sira para kōī. bhāvai manahi karahu tumha sōī..</h5> <h5>bhalēhi maṃda maṃdēhi bhala karahū. bisamaya haraṣa na hiyaom kachu dharahū..

[1-136-4]</h5> <p>You are absolutely independent and subordinate to none; therefore You do whatever pleases Your mind. You debase a good soul and redeem a vile person and neither rejoice nor grieve over it. Deceiving everyone You have become habituated to such tricks.You entertain no fear and are always zealous in pursuing Your object. Good and evil deeds do not come in Your way; no one has so far been able to correct You. You have this time played with fire and shall reap what You have sown. Take that very form in which You have imposed upon me: this is my curse. You made me look like a monkey; therefore You shall have monkeys for Your helpmates. And as You have grievously wronged me, so shall You suffer the pangs of separation from Your wife.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>śrāpa sīsa dharī haraṣi hiyaom prabhu bahu binatī kīnhi.</h5> <h5>nija māyā kai prabalatā karaṣi kṛpānidhi līnhi..137.. [1-137]</h5> <p>Gladly accepting the curse, the compassionate Lord made many entreaties to the sage, and withdrew the irresistible charm of His Māyā.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>jaba hari māyā dūri nivārī. nahiṃ tahaom ramā na rājakumārī..</h5> <h5>taba muni ati sabhīta hari caranā. gahē pāhi pranatārati haranā..

[1-137-4]</h5> <p>When Śrī Hari lifted the spell of His Māyā, there was neither Rāma nor the princess to be seen by His side. In dire dismay the sage then clasped the feet of Hari and said, &ldquo;O Reliever of the distress of the suppliant, save me! O gracious lord! let my curse prove ineffectual.&rdquo; It was My will,&rdquo; replied the Lord, who is so merciful to the humble. &ldquo;I poured many abuses at You,&rdquo; the sage repeated, &ldquo;how shall my sins be expiated? &ldquo;Go and repeat the names of Śaṅkara a hundred times; your heart will be disburdened at once. No one is so dear to Me as Śiva: never give up this belief even by mistake. O sage, he who does not earn the good-will of Śiva shall never attain true devotion to Me. Bearing this in mind, go and perambulate the globe. My Māyā shall haunt you no more.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bahubidhi munihi prabōdhi prabhu taba bhaē aṃtaradhāna..</h5> <h5>satyalōka nārada calē karata rāma guna gāna..138.. [1-138]</h5> <p>Having thus reassured the sage, the Lord then disappeared; while Nārada proceeded to Satyaloka (the seventh paradise, the abode of Brahmā) chanting Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s praises as he went</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>hara gana munihi jāta patha dēkhī. bigatamōha mana haraṣa bisēṣī..</h5> <h5>ati sabhīta nārada pahiṃ āē. gahi pada ārata bacana sunāē..

[1-138-4]</h5> <p>When the attendants of Śiva saw the sage moving along the road free from delusion and greatly delighted at heart, they approached him in great alarm and, clasping his feet, spoke to him in great humility, &ldquo;We are servants of Śiva and no Brāhmaṇas, O great sage; we committed a great sin and have reaped its fruit. Now rid us of the curse, O benevolent sage.&rdquo; Nārada, who was full of compassion to the humble, replied, &ldquo;Both of you go and take the form of demons. You shall possess an enormous fortune, grandeur and strength. When you have subdued the universe by the might of your arm, God Viṣṇu shall take a human form. Dying at His hands in battle, you shall be liberated and shall never be reborn.&rdquo; Bowing their head at the sage&rsquo;s feet, both departed and were reborn as demons in due course.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ēka kalapa ēhi hētu prabhu līnha manuja avatāra.</h5> <h5>sura raṃjana sajjana sukhada hari bhaṃjana bhubi bhāra..139.. [1-139]</h5> <p>In one Kalpa (round of creation) it was for this reason that Lord Śrī Hari assumed a human form. It is His vow to gladden the gods, to delight the virtuous and to ease the earth of its burden. (139)</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>ēhi bidhi janama karama hari kērē. suṃdara sukhada bicitra ghanērē..</h5> <h5>kalapa kalapa prati prabhu avatarahīṃ. cāru carita nānābidhi karahīṃ.. [1-139-1]</h5> <h5>taba taba kathā munīsanha gāī. parama punīta prabaṃdha banāī..</h5> <h5>bibidha prasaṃga anūpa bakhānē. karahiṃ na suni ācaraju sayānē.. [1-139-2]</h5> <h5>hari anaṃta harikathā anaṃtā. kahahiṃ sunahiṃ bahubidhi saba saṃtā..</h5> <h5>rāmacaṃdra kē carita suhāē. kalapa kōṭi lagi jāhiṃ na gāē..

[1-139-4]</h5> <p>Thus Śrī Hari&rsquo;s births and exploits are many; they are all charming, delightful and marvellous. In every cycle of creation the Lord manifests Himself and enacts lovely sports of various kinds; and the great sages have on each such occasion sung His story in most sacred strains, relating wonderful anecdotes of diverse kinds, hearing which the wise marvel not. Infinite is Śrī Hari and infinite are His stories; each saint sings and hears them in divergent ways. The lovely sports of Rāmacandra cannot be sung even in crores of Kalpas.This episode, O Bhavānī, has been narrated by me in order to show that even enlightened sages are deluded by Śrī Hari&rsquo;s Māyā. The Lord is sportive and a friend of the suppliant; He is easy to serve and rids one of all sorrows.</p> <h4>Sortas</h4> <h5>sura nara muni kōu nāhiṃ jēhi na mōha māyā prabala..</h5> <h5>asa bicāri mana māhiṃ bhajia mahāmāyā patihi..140.. [1-139-140]</h5> <p>There is no god, man or sage whom Śrī Hari&rsquo;s powerful Māyā cannot infatuate. Bearing this in mind, one should adore the Lord of this great Māyā. (140)</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>apara hētu sunu sailakumārī. kahau bicitra kathā bistārī..</h5> <h5>jēhi kārana aja aguna arūpā. brahma bhayau kōsalapura bhūpā.. [1-139-1]</h5> <h5>jō prabhu bipina phirata tumha dēkhā. baṃdhu samēta dharēṃ munibēṣā..</h5> <h5>jāsu carita avalōki bhavānī. satī sarīra rahihu baurānī.. [1-139-2]</h5> <h5>ajahu na chāyā miṭati tumhārī. tāsu carita sunu bhrama ruja hārī..</h5> <h5>līlā kīnhi jō tēhiṃ avatārā. sō saba kahihau mati anusārā.. [1-139-3]</h5> <h5>bharadvāja suni saṃkara bānī. sakuci saprēma umā musakānī..</h5> <h5>lagē bahuri baranē bṛṣakētū. sō avatāra bhayau jēhi hētū.. [1-139-4]</h5> <p>Hear, O daughter of the mountain-king, another reason why the unbegotten, unqualified and formless Brahma became king of Ayodhyā. I shall relate at length the marvellous story connected with it. The Lord whom you saw roaming in the forest with His brother (Lakṣmaṇa) in the garb of hermits, and whose doings drove you mad in the form of Sati to such an extent that the shadow of that madness haunts you even to this day-hear His exploits, which serve as a cure for the disease of delusion. The sportive deeds that were performed by the Lord in that birth, I shall relate them all to the best of My talents. Hearing Śaṅkara&rsquo;s words, O Bharadvāja, Umā blushed and smiled with love. Śiva (who has a bull emblazoned on His standard) then began to relate the cause of the Lord&rsquo;s descent on that particular occasion.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-6 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1/30" > <span>Previous (Part - 30)</span> </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1/32" > <span>Next (Part - 32)</span> </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Scriptures/Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (Tulsi Ramayana)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>1 - Baal Kaand</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1/31"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part - 31</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img loading=lazy  src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png" > </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-html> <div class=content > <p>Please select your language</p> </div> </swal-html> <swal-input type=radio  value=hi > <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/language-selector.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
