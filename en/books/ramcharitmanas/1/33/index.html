[1-152-4]</h5> <p>Listen, O sage, to an old and sacred legend which was narrated by Śambhu to Girijā. There was a principality known by the name of Kaikaya, which was celebrated throughout the world. A king named Satyaketu ruled there. He was a champion of virtue, a storehouse of political wisdom, dignified, glorious, amiable and powerful. He had two gallant sons, who were repositories of all virtues and most staunch in battle. The elder of the two and the heir to the throne was named Pratāpabhānu. The other was known by the name of Arimardana, who was unequalled in strength of arm and steady in battle. There was perfect unity between the two brothers and the affection each bore to the other was free from all blemish and guile. To the elder son the king resigned the throne and withdrew himself into the forest for the sake of devotion to Śrī Hari.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jaba pratāparabi bhayau nṛpa phirī dōhāī dēsa.</h5> <h5>prajā pāla ati bēdabidhi katahu nahīṃ agha lēsa..153.. [1-153]</h5> <p>When Pratāpabhānu became king, a proclamation to this effect was made throughout the land. He looked after his subjects with utmost care according to the precepts of the Vedas and there was not a speck of sin anywhere (in his kingdom).</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>nṛpa hitakāraka saciva sayānā. nāma dharamaruci sukra samānā..</h5> <h5>saciva sayāna baṃdhu balabīrā. āpu pratāpapuṃja ranadhīrā.. [1-153-1]</h5> <h5>sēna saṃga caturaṃga apārā. amita subhaṭa saba samara jujhārā..</h5> <h5>sēna bilōki rāu haraṣānā. aru bājē gahagahē nisānā..

[1-153-4]</h5> <p>The prime minister, Dharmaruci by name, was a second Śukra* and was as devoted to the king as he was wise. With a prudent counseller and a gallant and powerful brother, the king himself was an embodiment of glory and daring in war. He owned a vast army consisting of horse and foot, chariots and elephants. It had numberless excellent warriors all of whom fought fearlessly in battle. The king rejoiced to see his army and there was a tumultuous sound of kettledrums. He collected a special force for the conquest of the world, and availing himself of an auspicious day marched forth with beat of drums. A number of battles were fought here and there and all hostile kings were brought to their knees by superior might. By the strength of his arm be reduced all the seven sections of the terrestrial region and let the princes go on payment of tribute. Now Pratāpabhānu was the undisputed sovereign of the entire globe.</p> <ul> <li><strong>*</strong> The celebrated preceptor of the Daityas, who is noted for his political insight and is credited with the authorship of the famous work on political science, Śukranīti. </ul> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>svabasa bisva kari bāhubala nija pura kīnha prabēsu.</h5> <h5>aratha dharama kāmādi sukha sēvai samayaom narēsu..154.. [1-154]</h5> <p>Having thus subjugated the whole universe by the might of his arm, the king reentered his capital. He devoted himself to the pleasures of wealth, religious practices and sense-gratification etc., at the appropriate time.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhūpa pratāpabhānu bala pāī. kāmadhēnu bhai bhūmi suhāī..</h5> <h5>saba dukha barajita prajā sukhārī. dharamasīla suṃdara nara nārī.. [1-154-1]</h5> <h5>saciva dharamaruci hari pada prītī. nṛpa hita hētu sikhava nita nītī..</h5> <h5>gura sura saṃta pitara mahidēvā. karai sadā nṛpa saba kai sēvā..

[1-154-4]</h5> <p>Invigorated by king Pratāpabhānu&rsquo;s might, the charming earth became a cow of plenty as it were (yielded all one&rsquo;s coveted products). The people were happy and free from all sorrows and both men and women were good-looking and virtuous. The minister, Dharmaruci, was devoted to the feet of Śrī Hari; in the interest of his royal master he advised him on state policy everyday. Preceptors, gods, saints, manes and Brāhmaṇas- the king invariably served them all. Whatever duties have been enjoined on a king in the Vedas, he gladly and devoutly performed. He bestowed gifts of various kinds everyday and listened to the best scriptures including the Vedas and the Purāṇas. In all holy places he constructed many small and big wells and tanks, flower gardens and lovely orchards, dwellings for the Brāhmaṇas and beautiful temples of wonderful architecture.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jaomha lagi kahē purāna śruti ēka ēka saba jāga.</h5> <h5>bāra sahastra sahastra nṛpa kiē sahita anurāga..155.. [1-155]</h5> <p>Whatever sacrifices have been enjoined in the Vedas and the Purāṇas, the king devoutly performed each one of them a thousand times.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>hṛdayaom na kachu phala anusaṃdhānā. bhūpa bibēkī parama sujānā..</h5> <h5>karai jē dharama karama mana bānī. bāsudēva arpita nṛpa gyānī.. [1-155-1]</h5> <h5>caḍhai bara bāji bāra ēka rājā. mṛgayā kara saba sāji samājā..</h5> <h5>biṃdhyācala gabhīra bana gayaū. mṛga punīta bahu mārata bhayaū.. [1-155-2]</h5> <h5>phirata bipina nṛpa dīkha barāhū. janu bana durēu sasihi grasi rāhū..</h5> <h5>baḍa bidhu nahi samāta mukha māhīṃ. manahu krōdhabasa ugilata nāhīṃ.. [1-155-3]</h5> <h5>kōla karāla dasana chabi gāī. tanu bisāla pīvara adhikāī..</h5> <h5>ghurughurāta haya ārau pāēom. cakita bilōkata kāna uṭhāēom.. [1-155-4]</h5> <p>There was no seeking for any reward in his heart; the king was a man of great intelligence and wisdom. Whatever meritorious act he performed in thought, word or deed, the wise king dedicated it to Lord Vāsudeva (the all-pervading God Viṣṇu). Equipping himself with all the outfit of hunting, the king mounted a gallant steed one day and, entering the dense forest of the Vindhya range, killed many a sacred deer. While ranging in the wood he espied a wild boar. It looked as if with the moon in his mouth the demon Rāhu had hid in the forest. The orb was too large to be contained in the mouth, yet in his rage he would not disgorge it. Thus have I chosen to portray the beauty of the frightful tusks of the boar, while its body too was of an enormous size and bulk. Growling at the tramp of the horse and pricking up its ears it gazed with a startled look</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>nīla mahīdhara sikhara sama dēkhi bisāla barāhu.</h5> <h5>capari calēu haya suṭuki nṛpa hāomki na hōi nibāhu..156.. [1-156]</h5> <p>On seeing the huge boar, which resembled a purple mountain-peak, the king whipped the horse and advanced rapidly, challenging the boar at the same time and saying it could no longer escape.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>āvata dēkhi adhika rava bājī. calēu barāha maruta gati bhājī..</h5> <h5>turata kīnha nṛpa sara saṃdhānā. mahi mili gayau bilōkata bānā.. [1-156-1]</h5> <h5>taki taki tīra mahīsa calāvā. kari chala suara sarīra bacāvā..</h5> <h5>pragaṭata durata jāi mṛga bhāgā. risa basa bhūpa calēu saṃga lāgā.. [1-156-2]</h5> <h5>gayau dūri ghana gahana barāhū. jahaom nāhina gaja bāji nibāhū..</h5> <h5>ati akēla bana bipula kalēsū. tadapi na mṛga maga tajai narēsū.. [1-156-3]</h5> <h5>kōla bilōki bhūpa baḍa dhīrā. bhāgi paiṭha giriguhāom gabhīrā..</h5> <h5>agama dēkhi nṛpa ati pachitāī. phirēu mahābana parēu bhulāī.. [1-156-4]</h5> <p>When it saw the horse coming on with a great noise, the boar took to flight swift as wind. The king lost no time in fitting the arrow to his bow and the boar crouched as soon as it saw the shaft. The king discharged his arrows taking a steady aim each time, but the boar saved itself by its wiliness. The beast rushed on, now hiding and now emerging into view; while the king in much excitement followed closely on its track. The boar went afar into a dense thicket, which was impenetrable by horse or elephant. Even though the king was all by himself and was faced with untold hardships in the forest, still he would not abandon the chase. Seeing the king so determined, the boar slunk away into a deep mountain-cave. When the king perceived that there was no access to the cave, he had to return much disappointed; and, what was worse, he lost his track in the great forest.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>khēda khinna chuddhita tṛṣita rājā bāji samēta.</h5> <h5>khōjata byākula sarita sara jala binu bhayau acēta..157.. [1-157]</h5> <p>Exhausted with much exertion and oppressed by hunger and thirst, the king and his horse kept searching for a stream or pond and almost fainted for want of water.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>phirata bipina āśrama ēka dēkhā. tahaom basa nṛpati kapaṭa munibēṣā..</h5> <h5>jāsu dēsa nṛpa līnha chaḍaāī. samara sēna taji gayau parāī.. [1-157-1]</h5> <h5>samaya pratāpabhānu kara jānī. āpana ati asamaya anumānī..</h5> <h5>gayau na gṛha mana bahuta galānī. milā na rājahi nṛpa abhimānī.. [1-157-2]</h5> <h5>risa ura māri raṃka jimi rājā. bipina basai tāpasa kēṃ sājā..</h5> <h5>tāsu samīpa gavana nṛpa kīnhā. yaha pratāparabi tēhi taba cīnhā.. [1-157-3]</h5> <h5>rāu tṛṣita nahi sō pahicānā. dēkhi subēṣa mahāmuni jānā..</h5> <h5>utari turaga tēṃ kīnha pranāmā. parama catura na kahēu nija nāmā.. [1-157-4]</h5> <p>While wandering in the forest he espied a hermitage. In that hermitage dwelt, in the disguise of a hermit, a monarch who had been despoiled of his kingdom by Pratāpabhānu and who had run away from the field of battle deserting his army. Knowing that the time was propitious for Pratāpabhānu and most unfavourable to his own self, he felt much disgusted at heart and refused to return home; and he was too proud to come to terms with the victor. Suppressing the anger in his own heart the ex-king lived in the forest like a pauper in the garb of an anchorite. It was to him that king Pratāpabhānu went and he for his part immediately recognized that the newcomer was no other than Pratāpabhānu. Overcome by thirst, the latter, however, could not recognize the ex-king. Perceiving his holy garb Pratāpabhānu took him to be a great sage and, getting down from his horse, made obeisance to him. The king was, however, too astute to disclose his name.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhūpati tṛṣita bilōki tēhiṃ sarabaru dīnha dēkhāi.</h5> <h5>majjana pāna samēta haya kīnha nṛpati haraṣāi..158.. [1-158]</h5> <p>Seeing king Pratāpabhānu thirsty, he showed him a good lake and the king as well as his horse gladly bathed in it and drank from it.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>gai śrama sakala sukhī nṛpa bhayaū. nija āśrama tāpasa lai gayaū..</h5> <h5>āsana dīnha asta rabi jānī. puni tāpasa bōlēu mṛdu bānī.. [1-158-1]</h5> <h5>kō tumha kasa bana phirahu akēlēṃ. suṃdara jubā jīva parahēlēṃ..</h5> <h5>cakrabarti kē lacchana tōrēṃ. dēkhata dayā lāgi ati mōrēṃ.. [1-158-2]</h5> <h5>nāma pratāpabhānu avanīsā. tāsu saciva maiṃ sunahu munīsā..</h5> <h5>phirata ahērēṃ parēu bhulāī. baḍē bhāga dēkhau pada āī.. [1-158-3]</h5> <h5>hama kahaom durlabha darasa tumhārā. jānata hauṃ kachu bhala hōnihārā..</h5> <h5>kaha muni tāta bhayau aomdhiyārā. jōjana sattari nagaru tumhārā.. [1-158-4]</h5> <p>The whole fatigue was gone and the king heaved a sigh of relief. The hermit thereafter took him back to his hermitage; and perceiving that it was sunset now he gave him a seat and then spoke to him in polite terms, &ldquo;Who are you and wherefore do you risk your life by roaming in the forest all alone, even though you are so young and handsome? Reading the marks of an emperor on your person I am moved with great pity.&rdquo; &ldquo;Listen, O great sage: there is a king named Pratāpabhānu; I am his minister. Ranging in pursuit of game I have lost my way and by great good fortune I have been led into your presence. Your sight is a rare boon to me; it leads me to believe that something good is about to befall me.&rdquo; The hermit said, &ldquo;It is now dusk, my son; and your city is five hundred and sixty miles away.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>nisā ghōra gambhīra bana paṃtha na sunahu sujāna.</h5> <h5>basahu āju asa jāni tumha jāehu hota bihāna.159ka.. [1-159(A)]</h5> <h5>tulasī jasi bhavatabyatā taisī milai sahāi.</h5> <h5>āpunu āvai tāhi pahiṃ tāhi tahāom lai jāi..159kha.. [1-159(B)]</h5> <p>Listen, O friend: dark and dreary is the night, and the forest is dense and trackless; knowing this, tarry here overnight and depart next morning. The inevitable, says Tulasīdāsa, is invariably preceded by circumstances that are favourable to it. Either it comes to a man or takes him to the cause of his doom.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhalēhiṃ nātha āyasu dhari sīsā. bāomdhi turaga taru baiṭha mahīsā..</h5> <h5>nrpa bahu bhāti prasamseu tāhi, carana bamdi nija bhāgya sarāhi.. [1-159(B)-1]</h5> <h5>puni bōlē mṛdu girā suhāī. jāni pitā prabhu karau ḍhiṭhāī..</h5> <h5>mōhi munisa suta sēvaka jānī. nātha nāma nija kahahu bakhānī.. [1-159(B)-2]</h5> <h5>tēhi na jāna nṛpa nṛpahi sō jānā. bhūpa suhrada sō kapaṭa sayānā..</h5> <h5>bairī puni chatrī puni rājā. chala bala kīnha cahai nija kājā..

[1-159(B)-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Very well, my lord,&rdquo; the king replied; and bowing to the hermit&rsquo;s command he tied up the horse to a tree and then sat down. The king extolled him in many ways and bowing at his feet congratulated himself. He then spoke to him in soft and endearing terms, &ldquo;Regarding you as a father, my lord, I venture to address you. Looking upon me as your son and servant O great sage, pray tell me your name in full, my master.&rdquo; Although the king did not recognize him, he recognized the king. While the king had a guileless heart, the hermit was a pastmaster in fraud. Being an enemy in the first instance, and a Kṣatriya on top of it and again of royal blood, he sought to accomplish his end by dint of his cunning. The thought of the pleasures of royalty had made the enemy king sad; the fire of jealousy smouldered within his heart like that of a furnace. On hearing the artless words of Pratāpabhānu and recalling the grudge he had nursed against him, the hermit felt delighted at heart.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kapaṭa bōri bānī mṛdula bōlēu juguti samēta.</h5> <h5>nāma hamāra bhikhāri aba nirdhana rahita nikēti..160.. [1-160]</h5> <p>He uttered the following soft yet false and artful words, &ldquo;My name is now Bhikhārī (a mendicant), penniless and homeless as I am.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kaha nṛpa jē bigyāna nidhānā. tumha sārikhē galita abhimānā..</h5> <h5>sadā rahahi apanapau durāēom. saba bidhi kusala kubēṣa banāēom..

[1-160-2]</h5> <h5>jōsi sōsi tava carana namāmī. mō para kṛpā karia aba svāmī..</h5> <h5>sahaja prīti bhūpati kai dēkhī. āpu biṣaya bisvāsa bisēṣī.. [1-160-3]</h5> <h5>saba prakāra rājahi apanāī. bōlēu adhika sanēha janāī..</h5> <h5>sunu satibhāu kahau mahipālā. ihāom basata bītē bahu kālā.. [1-160-4]</h5> <p>The king replied, &ldquo;Those who are repositories of wisdom and free from pride like you always keep their reality concealed; even though proficient in everyway, they prefer to remain in tattered clothes. That is why saints as well as the Vedas proclaim that those who are supremely indigent are held most dear by Śrī Hari. Penniless and homeless beggars like you fill the minds of even Virañci and Śiva with doubt. Whoever you may be, I bow at Your feet; now be gracious to me, my lord.&rdquo; When the hermit saw the king&rsquo;s artless affection and extraordinary faith in him, he won him over in everyway, and spoke with a still greater affection &ldquo;Listen, O king; I tell you sincerely that I have dwelt here for long.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>aba lagi mōhi na milēu kōu maiṃ na janāvau kāhu.</h5> <h5>lōkamānyatā anala sama kara tapa kānana dāhu..161ka.. [1-161(A)]</h5> <h5>tulasī dēkhi subēṣu bhūlahiṃ mūḍha na catura nara.</h5> <h5>suṃdara kēkihi pēkhu bacana sudhā sama asana ahi..161kha.. [1-161(A)-161(B)]</h5> <p>&ldquo;No one has come to me so far nor do I make myself known to anyone; for popular esteem is like a wild fire, which consumes the forest of penance (i.e., neutralizes it).&rdquo; Not only fools, says Tulasīdāsa, but even clever men are taken in by fair appearances. Look at the beautiful peacock: though its notes are sweet like nectar, it devours snakes.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>tātēṃ guputa rahau jaga māhīṃ. hari taji kimapi prayōjana nāhīṃ..</h5> <h5>prabhu jānata saba binahiṃ janāēom. kahahu kavani sidhi lōka rijhāēom.. [1-161(A)-1]</h5> <h5>tumha suci sumati parama priya mōrēṃ. prīti pratīti mōhi para tōrēṃ..</h5> <h5>aba jauṃ tāta durāvau tōhī. dāruna dōṣa ghaṭai ati mōhī..

[1-161(A)-3]</h5> <h5>nāma hamāra ēkatanu bhāī. suni nṛpa bōlē puni siru nāī..</h5> <h5>kahahu nāma kara aratha bakhānī. mōhi sēvaka ati āpana jānī.. [1-161(A)-4]</h5> <p>That is why I live in this world away from the public gaze. I have little to do with anything other than Śrī Hari. The Lord knows everything without being told; tell me, then, what is to be gained by humouring the world. You are sincere and intelligent and are therefore supremely dear to me; and I too have earned your affection and confidence. Now, my son, if I were to keep anything from you, I shall incur the most severe blame.&rdquo; The more the hermit talked of his indifference to the world the more trustful grew the king. When the false anchorite saw the king devoted to him in thought, word and deed, he said, &ldquo;My name, brother, is Ekatanu.&rdquo; Hearing this, the king bowed his head and asked further, &ldquo;Kindly explain to me the meaning of this appellation recognizing me as your faithful servant.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ādisṛṣṭi upajī jabahiṃ taba utapati bhai mōri.</h5> <h5>nāma ēkatanu hētu tēhi dēha na dharī bahōri..162..

By dint of penance Brahmā creates the universe; by dint of penance Viṣṇu assumed the role of its protector. By dint of penance, again, Śambhu destroys the world; there is nothing in this world which cannot be attained through penance.&rdquo; Hearing this, the king felt much enamoured and the hermit commenced relating old legends. Having discussed topics of Karma (action) and Dharma (duty) and told many legends bearing on them he discoursed on dispassion and knowledge. And he further related at length countless marvellous stories connected with the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the universe. Hearing all this the king completely yielded to the influence of the hermit and then proceeded to tell him his real name. Said the hermit, &ldquo;O king, I know you. Even though you tried to deceive me, I appreciated this move on your part.</p> <h4>Sortas</h4> <h5>sunu mahīsa asi nīti jahaom tahaom nāma na kahahiṃ nṛpa.</h5> <h5>mōhi tōhi para ati prīti sōi caturatā bicāri tava..163..

I am now pleased; doubt not and ask what you will, O king.&rdquo; Hearing these agreeable words, the king rejoiced and, clasping the hermit&rsquo;s feet, supplicated to him in many ways. &ldquo;O gracious sage, by your very sight I have within my grasp all the four ends of human existence (viz., religious merit, wealth, enjoyment and final beatitude). Yet, as I see my lord so gracious, I would ask a boon which is impossible to attain otherwise, and thereby overcome sorrow.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jarā marana dukha rahita tanu samara jitai jani kōu.</h5> <h5>ēkachatra ripuhīna mahi rāja kalapa sata hōu..164..

The only exception shall be the Brāhmaṇas, O ruler of the earth. The Brāhmaṇas are ever powerful by virtue of their penance; no one can deliver from their wrath. If you can reduce the Brāhmaṇas to your will, O king, even Brahma, Viṣṇu and the great Lord Śiva shall be at your command. Might is of no avail against the Brāhmaṇas; with both arms raised to heaven I tell you this truth. Listen, O sovereign; if you escape the Brāhmaṇa&rsquo;s curse, you shall never perish.&rdquo; Hearing his words, the king rejoiced and said, &ldquo;My lord, I shall no longer die.

A Guru can save one even if one has evoked the wrath of Brahma; but in the event of a quarrel with one&rsquo;s preceptor there is no one in the world who can save.

Of course, there is one very simple device; but that too involves one difficulty. Its contrivance depends on me; but my going to your city is out of the question. Ever since I was born I have never been to anybody&rsquo;s house or village so far. And if I do not go, it will be a misfortune for you. I am therefore in a dilemma today.&rdquo; Hearing this, the king replied in a polite language, &ldquo;My lord, there is a maxim laid down in the Vedas: the great show kindness to the small. Mountains always bear tiny blades of grass on their tops, the fathomless ocean carries floating foam on its breast and the earth ever bears dust on its bosom.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>asa kahi gahē narēsa pada svāmī hōhu kṛpāla.</h5> <h5>mōhi lāgi dukha sahia prabhu sajjana dīnadayāla..167..

For me in this world there is nothing hard to obtain. I will surely accomplish your object, devoted as you are in thought, word and deed to me. The power of Yoga (contemplation), planning, penance and mystic formulas works only when secrecy is maintained about them. O king, if I cook food and you serve it and if nobody comes to know me, whoever tastes the food so prepared shall become amenable to your orders. Again, I tell you, whosoever dines at the house of such people shall, O king, be dominated by your will.

I give you one more sign. I will never come in this form. By my delusive power, O king, I will carry off your family priest and, making him just like myself by dint of my penance, will keep him here for the year; while I, O king, will take his form and manage everything for you.

Deep sleep came upon the weary monarch; but how could the other fellow sleep, distracted as he was with anxiety. The demon Kālaketu made his appearance there; it was he who had assumed the form of a boar and led the king astray. A great friend of the hermit-king, he was skilled in manifold ways of deceit. He had a hundred sons and ten brothers, who were great villains, invincible and annoying to the gods. Seeing the Brāhmaṇas, saints and gods in distress the king had already killed them all in battle. Recalling the old grudge the wretch conspired with the hermit-king and contrived a plot for the extermination of the enemy; but, as fate would have it, the king knew nothing of it.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ripu tējasī akēla api laghu kari gania na tāhu.</h5> <h5>ajahu dēta dukha rabi sasihi sira avasēṣita rāhu..170..

The demon, however consists of the head alone, his trunk having been cut off by God Viṣṇu while he was unlawfully attempting to partake of the nectar which was being served to the gods. Since, however, he had already tasted the nectar, the head became immortal. </ul> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>tāpasa nṛpa nija sakhahi nihārī. haraṣi milēu uṭhi bhayau sukhārī..</h5> <h5>mitrahi kahi saba kathā sunāī. jātudhāna bōlā sukha pāī..

The demon too was glad and said, &ldquo;Listen, O king: since you have followed my advice, take the enemy as subdued. Cease to worry now and lay yourself to rest. God has effected a cure without the use of a medicine, I will sweep away the enemy root and branch and see you on the fourth day.&rdquo; Fully reassuring the hermit-king, the arch-impostor, who was highly irascible, departed. In an instant he conveyed Pratāpabhānu to his palace, horse and all. Putting the king to bed beside his queen, he tied up the horse in the stall in the proper way.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>rājā kē uparōhitahi hari lai gayau bahōri.</h5> <h5>lai rākhēsi giri khōha mahu māyāom kari mati bhōri..171..

The king woke even before daybreak and felt much astonished to find himself at home. Attributing the miracle to the supernatural power of the sage, he got up quietly, unperceived by the queen. Mounting the same horse he rode off to the woods without any man or woman of the city knowing it. When it was midday, the king returned; there was rejoicing and festal music in every house. When the king saw his family-priest, he looked at him in amazement, recollecting the object he held so dear to his heart. The interval of three days hung heavy on the monarch as an age, his mind being set on the feet of the false anchorite. At the appointed time the priest came and reminded him in detail of all that had been agreed upon</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>nṛpa haraṣēu pahicāni guru bhrama basa rahā na cēta.</h5> <h5>barē turata sata sahasa bara bipra kuṭuṃba samēta..172..

He prepared an illusory banquet and a variety of seasoned dishes more than one could count. Dressing the flesh of a variety of animals the wretch mixed with it the cooked flesh of Brāhmaṇas. All the invited Brāhmaṇas were then called for the dinner. Their feet were duly washed and they were respectfully shown to their places. The moment the king began to serve the food, a (fictitious) voice from heaven (raised by the demon Kālaketu himself) said, &ldquo;Up, up, Brāhmaṇas! and return to your homes. Taste not this food; it is most harmful. The dishes include the flesh of the Brāhmaṇas.&rdquo; Up rose all the Brāhmaṇas believing the ethereal voice. The king lost his nerve; his mind was bewildered with infatuation. As fate would have it, he could not utter a word.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bōlē bipra sakōpa taba nahiṃ kachu kīnha bicāra.</h5> <h5>jāi nisācara hōhu nṛpa mūḍha sahita parivāra..173..

In the course of a year you shall perish; and not a soul shall be left in your family to offer water to gratify your spirit.&rdquo; Hearing the curse the king was sore stricken with fear. Again, a voice was heard from heaven, &ldquo;O holy Brāhmaṇas you have uttered this curse without careful thought; the king has committed no crime.&rdquo; The Brāhmaṇas were astounded when they heard the ethereal voice. The king hastened to the kitchen. There was neither any food there nor the Brāhmaṇa cook. The king returned in deep thought. He related the whole story to the Brāhmaṇas and threw himself on the ground frantic with fear.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhūpati bhāvī miṭai nahiṃ jadapi na dūṣana tōra.</h5> <h5>kiēom anyathā hōi nahiṃ bipraśrāpa ati ghōra..174..

Conveying the priest to his house, the demon (Kālaketu) communicated the tidings to the hermit. The wretch in his turn despatched letters in all directions and a host of princes hastened with their troops martially arrayed and, beating their kettledrums, beleaguered the city. Everyday battles were fought in diverse forms. All his champions fought valiantly and fell. And the king with his brother bit the dust.
