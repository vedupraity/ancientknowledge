[1-262]</h5> <p>Talented bards, minstrels and panegyrists sang praises; and everybody gave away horses, elephants, riches, jewels and raiments as an act of invocation of God&rsquo;s blessings on the youthful champion.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>jhāomjhi mṛdaṃga saṃkha sahanāī. bhēri ḍhōla duṃdubhī suhāī..</h5> <h5>bājahiṃ bahu bājanē suhāē. jahaom tahaom jubatinha maṃgala gāē.. [1-262-1]</h5> <h5>sakhinha sahita haraṣī ati rānī. sūkhata dhāna parā janu pānī..</h5> <h5>janaka lahēu sukhu sōcu bihāī. pairata thakēṃ thāha janu pāī..

[1-262-4]</h5> <p>There was a crash of cymbals and tabors, conches and clarionets, drums and sweet-sounding kettledrums, both large and small; and many other charming instruments also played. Everywhere young women sang auspicious strains. The queen with her companions was much delighted, as though a withering crop of paddy had been refreshed by a shower. King Janaka was now care-free and felt gratified as if a tired swimmer had reached a shallow. The kings&rsquo; countenance fell at the breaking of the bow, just as a lamp is dimmed at dawn of day. Sītā&rsquo;s delight could only be compared to that of a female Cātaka* bird on receiving a rain-drop when the sun is in the same longitude as the constellation named Svātī* (Arcturus). Lakṣmaṇa fixed his eyes on Rāma as the young of a Cakora bird gazes on the moon. Śatānanda then gave the word and Sītā advanced towards Rāma .</p> <ul> <li><strong>*</strong> According to the Indian tradition a Cātaka bird would slake its thirst only with a rain-drop obtained when the sun is in the same longitude as the Arcturus (which is generally in the month of October, a month when showers are of rare occurrence). </ul> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>saṃga sakhīṃ sudaṃra catura gāvahiṃ maṃgalacāra.</h5> <h5>gavanī bāla marāla gati suṣamā aṃga apāra..263.. [1-263]</h5> <p>Accompanied by Her fair and talented companions, who were singing festal songs, She paced like a cygnet, Her limbs possessing infinite charm.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sakhinha madhya siya sōhati kaisē. chabigana madhya mahāchabi jaisēṃ..</h5> <h5>kara sarōja jayamāla suhāī. bisva bijaya sōbhā jēhiṃ chāī.. [1-263-1]</h5> <h5>tana sakōcu mana parama uchāhū. gūḍha prēmu lakhi parai na kāhū..</h5> <h5>jāi samīpa rāma chabi dēkhī. rahi janu kuari citra avarēkhī..

[1-263-4]</h5> <p>In the midst of Her companions Sītā shone as a personification of supreme beauty among other embodiments of beauty. She held in one of Her lotus hands the fair wreath of victory, resplendent with the glory of triumph over the whole universe. While Her body shrank with modesty, Her heart was full of rapture; Her hidden love could not be perceived by others. As She drew near and beheld Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s beauty, Princess Sītā stood motionless as a portrait. A clever companion, who perceived Her in this condition, exhorted Her saying,&rdquo; Invest the bridegroom with the beautiful wreath of victory.&rdquo; At this She raised the wreath with both of Her hands, but was too overwhelmed with emotion to garland Him. In this act Her uplifted hands shone as if a pair of lotuses with their stalks were timidly investing the moon with a wreath of victory. At this charming sight Her companions broke into a song, while Sītā placed the wreath of victory round Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s neck so as to adorn His breast.</p> <h4>Sortas</h4> <h5>raghubara ura jayamāla dēkhi dēva barisahiṃ sumana.</h5> <h5>sakucē sakala bhuāla janu bilōki rabi kumudagana..264.. [1-263-264]</h5> <p>Witnessing the wreath of victory resting on Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s bosom, gods rained down flowers; while the kings all shrank in confusion like lillies at the rising of the sun.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>pura aru byōma bājanē bājē. khala bhaē malina sādhu saba rājē..</h5> <h5>sura kiṃnara nara nāga munīsā. jaya jaya jaya kahi dēhiṃ asīsā.. [1-263-1]</h5> <h5>nācahiṃ gāvahiṃ bibudha badhūṭīṃ. bāra bāra kusumāṃjali chūṭīṃ..</h5> <h5>jahaom tahaom bipra bēdadhuni karahīṃ. baṃdī biradāvali uccarahīṃ..

[1-263-3]</h5> <h5>sōhati sīya rāma kai jaurī. chabi siṃgāru manahu ēka ṭhōrī..</h5> <h5>sakhīṃ kahahiṃ prabhupada gahu sītā. karati na carana parasa ati bhītā.. [1-263-4]</h5> <p>There was music both in the city and in the heavens; while the wicked were downcast, the virtuous beamed with joy. Gods, Kiṁnaras, men, Nāgas and great sages uttered blessings with shouts of victory. Celestial dames danced and sang and handfuls of flowers were showered again and again. Here and there the Brāhmaṇas recited the Vedas, while panegyrists sang praises. The glad tidings spread throughout the earth, the subterranean regions and heaven that Śrī Rāma had broken the bow and won the hand of Sītā. The people of the city waved lights round the pair in order to ward off evil; and regardless of their means they scattered gifts in profusion as an act of invocation of Divine blessings on the couple. The pair of Śrī Rāma and Sītā shone as if beauty and the sentiment of Love had met together in human form. Her companions urged Her,&rdquo;Sītā, clasp your lord&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo; But Sītā was too much afraid to touch His feet.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>gautama tiya gati surati kari nahiṃ parasati paga pāni.</h5> <h5>mana bihasē raghubaṃsamani prīti alaukika jāni..265.. [1-265]</h5> <p>Remembering the fate of the sage Gautama&rsquo;s wife, Ahalyā, She would not touch His feet with Her hands; the Jewel of Raghu&rsquo;s race inwardly smiled to perceive Her transcendent love.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>taba siya dēkhi bhūpa abhilāṣē. kūra kapūta mūḍha mana mākhē..</h5> <h5>uṭhi uṭhi pahiri sanāha abhāgē. jahaom tahaom gāla bajāvana lāgē.. [1-265-1]</h5> <h5>lēhu chaḍaāi sīya kaha kōū. dhari bāomdhahu nṛpa bālaka dōū..</h5> <h5>tōrēṃ dhanuṣu cāḍa nahiṃ saraī. jīvata hamahi kuaomri kō baraī.. [1-265-2]</h5> <h5>jauṃ bidēhu kachu karai sahāī. jītahu samara sahita dōu bhāī..</h5> <h5>sādhu bhūpa bōlē suni bānī. rājasamājahi lāja lajānī.. [1-265-3]</h5> <h5>balu pratāpu bīratā baḍaāī. nāka pinākahi saṃga sidhāī..</h5> <h5>sōi sūratā ki aba kahu pāī. asi budhi tau bidhi muhaom masi lāī.. [1-265-4]</h5> <p>Then, as they looked on Sītā, a few princes were filled with longing for her; those wicked, degenerate fools grew indignant. Rising from their seats one after another and donning their armour the wretches began to brag about. Someone said, &ldquo;Carry off Sītā by force and capturing the two princes hold them in bondage. No purpose will be served by merely breaking the bow; for who shall marry the princess while we still live? Should Janaka come forward to help them, rout him in battle alongwith the two brothers.&rdquo; When the good kings heard these words, they said, &ldquo;Shame itself feels shy in approaching this assembly of princes. Your might, glory, valour, fame and honour have been shattered alongwith the bow. Is it the same valour of which you are boasting, or have you since acquired it anew from somewhere else? It is because such is your mentality that God has blackened your faces.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>dēkhahu rāmahi nayana bhari taji iriṣā madu kōhu.</h5> <h5>lakhana rōṣu pāvaku prabala jāni salabha jani hōhu..266.. [1-266]</h5> <p>Giving up jealousy, arrogance and anger, therefore, feast your eyes upon Rāma; and knowing Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s wrath to be a blazing fire, do not allow yourselves to be consumed by it like a moth.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bainatēya bali jimi caha kāgū. jimi sasu cahai nāga ari bhāgū..</h5> <h5>jimi caha kusala akārana kōhī. saba saṃpadā cahai sivadrōhī.. [1-266-1]</h5> <h5>lōbhī lōlupa kala kīrati cahaī. akalaṃkatā ki kāmī lahaī..</h5> <h5>hari pada bimukha parama gati cāhā. tasa tumhāra lālacu naranāhā.. [1-266-2]</h5> <h5>kōlāhalu suni sīya sakānī. sakhīṃ lavāi gaīṃ jahaom rānī..</h5> <h5>rāmu subhāyaom calē guru pāhīṃ. siya sanēhu baranata mana māhīṃ.. [1-266-3]</h5> <h5>rāninha sahita sōcabasa sīyā. aba dhauṃ bidhihi kāha karanīyā..</h5> <h5>bhūpa bacana suni ita uta takahīṃ. lakhanu rāma ḍara bōli na sakahīṃ.. [1-266-4]</h5> <p>As a crow should seek an offering set apart for Garuḍa (the king of birds), as a rabbit should covet the share of a lion, as a man who is angry without any cause should expect happiness, as an enemy of Śiva should crave for riches of all kinds, as a greedy and covetous man should long for good fame and as a gallant should aspire to be free from scandal, and as one who is averse to Śrī Hari&rsquo;s feet should hanker after the highest destiny (Liberation), your longing, O princes, (for Sītā) is of the same category.&rdquo; When Sītā heard the tumult, She got afraid and Her companions took Her to the queen; while Śrī Rāma advanced to His Guru, easy in mind and inwardly praising Her affection. The queens as well as Sītā were filled with anxiety and wondered what Providence had in store for them. On hearing the words of the princes Lakṣmaṇa looked hither and thither; for fear of Rāma, however, he could not speak.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>aruna nayana bhṛkuṭī kuṭila citavata nṛpanha sakōpa.</h5> <h5>manahu matta gajagana nirakhi siṃghakisōrahi cōpa..267.. [1-267]</h5> <p>With fiery eyes and knitted brows he cast an angry look at the kings, as though, at the sight of a herd of wild elephants in rut, a lion&rsquo;s whelp were eager to pounce on them.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kharabharu dēkhi bikala pura nārīṃ. saba mili dēhiṃ mahīpanha gārīṃ..</h5> <h5>tēhiṃ avasara suni siva dhanu bhaṃgā. āyasu bhṛgukula kamala pataṃgā.. [1-267-1]</h5> <h5>dēkhi mahīpa sakala sakucānē. bāja jhapaṭa janu lavā lukānē..</h5> <h5>gauri sarīra bhūti bhala bhrājā. bhāla bisāla tripuṃḍa birājā.. [1-267-2]</h5> <h5>sīsa jaṭā sasibadanu suhāvā. risabasa kachuka aruna hōi āvā..</h5> <h5>bhṛkuṭī kuṭila nayana risa rātē. sahajahu citavata manahu risātē.. [1-267-3]</h5> <h5>bṛṣabha kaṃdha ura bāhu bisālā. cāru janēu māla mṛgachālā..</h5> <h5>kaṭi muni basana tūna dui bāomdhēṃ. dhanu sara kara kuṭhāru kala kāomdhēṃ.. [1-267-4]</h5> <p>Seeing the uproar the women of the city were all distressed and joined in cursing the princes. The very moment arrived the sage Paraśurāma, a very sun to the lotus-like race of Bhṛgu, led by the news of the breaking of the bow. At his very sight the kings all cowered down even as a quail would shrink beneath the swoop of a hawk. A coat of ashes looked most charming on his fair body; his broad forehead was adorned with a Tripuṇḍra (as peculiar mark consisting of three horizontal lines, sacred to Śiva). Having matted locks on the head, his handsome moonlike face was a bit reddened with anger; with knitted brows and eyes inflamed with passion, his natural look gave one the impression that he was enraged. He had well-built shoulders like those of a bull and a broad chest and long arms; he was adorned with a beautiful sacred thread, rosary and deerskin. With an anchorite&rsquo;s covering about his loins and a pair of quivers fastened by his side, he held a bow and arrows in his hands and an axe upon his fair shoulder.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sāṃta bēṣu karanī kaṭhina barani na jāi sarupa.</h5> <h5>dhari munitanu janu bīra rasu āyau jahaom saba bhūpa..268.. [1-268]</h5> <p>Though saintly in attire, he had a cruel record of deeds; his character, therefore, defied description. It looked as if the heroic sentiment had taken the form of a hermit and arrived where the kings had assembled.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>dēkhata bhṛgupati bēṣu karālā. uṭhē sakala bhaya bikala bhuālā..</h5> <h5>pitu samēta kahi kahi nija nāmā. lagē karana saba daṃḍa pranāmā.. [1-268-1]</h5> <h5>jēhi subhāyaom citavahiṃ hitu jānī. sō jānai janu āi khuṭānī..</h5> <h5>janaka bahōri āi siru nāvā. sīya bōlāi pranāmu karāvā.. [1-268-2]</h5> <h5>āsiṣa dīnhi sakhīṃ haraṣānīṃ. nija samāja lai gaī sayānīṃ..</h5> <h5>bisvāmitru milē puni āī. pada sarōja mēlē dōu bhāī.. [1-268-3]</h5> <h5>rāmu lakhanu dasaratha kē ḍhōṭā. dīnhi asīsa dēkhi bhala jōṭā..</h5> <h5>rāmahi citai rahē thaki lōcana. rūpa apāra māra mada mōcana.. [1-268-4]</h5> <p>Beholding the frightful figure of Paraśurāma the kings all rose in consternation; and mentioning his own as well as his father&rsquo;s name, each fell prostrate on the ground before him. Even he on whom Paraśurāma cast a friendly look in a natural way thought the sands of his life had run out. Then came Janaka and bowed his head; and sending for Sītā he made Her pay homage to the sage. Her companions rejoiced when he bestowed his blessing on Her, and cleverly took Her where the other ladies were. Next came Viśvāmitra, who met him and placed the two brothers at his lotus feet, saying that they were King Daśaratha&rsquo;s sons, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa by name; seeing the well-matched pair, he blessed them. His eyes were rivetted on Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s incomparable beauty, which would humble the pride of Cupid himself.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bahuri bilōki bidēha sana kahahu kāha ati bhīra..</h5> <h5>pūchata jāni ajāna jimi byāpēu kōpu sarīra..269.. [1-269]</h5> <p>Then he looked round, and though knowing everything, he asked Videha, like one ignorant, &ldquo;Tell me, what has attracted all this crowd here?&rdquo; And as he spoke thus wrath took possession of his whole being.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>samācāra kahi janaka sunāē. jēhi kārana mahīpa saba āē..</h5> <h5>sunata bacana phiri anata nihārē. dēkhē cāpakhaṃḍa mahi ḍārē.. [1-269-1]</h5> <h5>ati risa bōlē bacana kaṭhōrā. kahu jaḍa janaka dhanuṣa kai tōrā..</h5> <h5>bēgi dēkhāu mūḍha na ta ājū. ulaṭau mahi jahaom lahi tava rājū.. [1-269-2]</h5> <h5>ati ḍaru utaru dēta nṛpu nāhīṃ. kuṭila bhūpa haraṣē mana māhīṃ..</h5> <h5>sura muni nāga nagara nara nārī..sōcahiṃ sakala trāsa ura bhārī..

[1-269-4]</h5> <p>Janaka narrated to him the whole history, mentioning what had brought all the kings there, on hearing this reply Paraśurāma turned round, and looking in the other direction he espied the fragments of the bow lying on the ground. Flying into a rage he spoke in harsh tones, &ldquo;Tell me, O stupid Janaka, who has broken the bow ? Show him at once, or this very day I will overthrow the whole tract of land over which your dominion extends.&rdquo; In his excess of fear, the king would make no answer; and the wicked kings were glad of heart. Gods, sages, Nāgas and the people of the city were all filled with anxiety; their hearts were much agitated. Sītā&rsquo;s mother lamented within herself, saying, &ldquo;Alas ! God has undone an accomplished fact.&rdquo; When Sītā heard of Paraśurāma&rsquo;s temperament, even half a moment passed to Her like a whole life-time of the universe.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sabhaya bilōkē lōga saba jāni jānakī bhīru.</h5> <h5>hṛdayaom na haraṣu biṣādu kachu bōlē śrīraghubīru..270..
