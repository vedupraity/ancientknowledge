And full of delight was all creation, animate and inanimate; for the birth of Śrī Rāma is the source of joy.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>naumī tithi madhu māsa punītā. sukala paccha abhijita hariprītā..</h5> <h5>madhyadivasa ati sīta na ghāmā. pāvana kāla lōka biśrāmā..

[1-190-4]</h5> <p>It was the ninth day of the bright half of the sacred month of Caitra; the moon had entered the asterism named Abhijit, which is so dear to Śrī Hari. The sun was at its meridian; the day was neither cold nor hot. It was a holy time which gave rest to the whole world. A cool, soft and fragrant breeze was blowing. The gods were feeling exhilarated and the saints were bubbling with enthusiasm. The woods were full of blossoms, the mountains were resplendent with gems and every river flowed a stream of nectar. When Brahmā perceived that the time of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s birth had approached, all the gods came out with their aerial cars duly equipped. The bright heaven was crowded with their hosts and troops of Gandharvas chanted praises and rained down flowers placing them in their beautiful palms. The sky resounded with the beat of kettedrums. Nāgas, sages and gods offered praises and tendered their services in manifold ways.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sura samūha binatī kari pahucē nija nija dhāma.</h5> <h5>jaganivāsa prabhu pragaṭē akhila lōka biśrāma..191.. [1-191]</h5> <p>Having offered their praises the gods returned to their several abodes, when the Lord, and abode of the universe and the solace of all creation, manifested Himself</p> <h4>Chhands</h4> <h5>bhaē pragaṭa kṛpālā dīnadayālā kausalyā hitakārī.</h5> <h5>haraṣita mahatārī muni mana hārī adbhuta rūpa bicārī..</h5> <h5>lōcana abhirāmā tanu ghanasyāmā nija āyudha bhuja cārī.</h5> <h5>bhūṣana banamālā nayana bisālā sōbhāsiṃdhu kharārī..

[1-191-4]</h5> <p>The gracious Lord, who is compassionate to the lowly and the benefactor of Kausalyā appeared. The thought of His marvellous form, which stole the heart of sages, filled the mother with joy. His body was dark as a cloud, the delight of all eyes; in His four arms He bore His characteristic emblems (a conch-shell, a discus, a club and a lotus). Adorned with jewels and a garland of sylvan flowers and endowed with large eyes, the Slayer of the demon Khara was an ocean of beauty. Joining both her palms the mother said, &ldquo;O infinite Lord, how can I praise You! The Vedas as well as the Purāṇas declare You as transcending Māyā, Guṇa (made of prakṛti) and beyond attributes, above knowledge and beyond all measure. He who is sung by the Vedas and holy men as an ocean of mercy and bliss and the repository of all virtues, the same Lord of Lakṣmī, the lover of His devotees, has revealed Himself for my good. The Vedas proclaim that every pore of Your body contains multitudes of universes brought forth by Māyā. That such a Lord stayed in my womb-this amusing story staggers the mind of even men of wisdom.&rdquo; When the revelation came upon the mother, the Lord smiled; He would perform many a sportive act. Therefore He exhorted her by telling her the charming account of her previous birth so that she might love Him as her own child. The mother&rsquo;s mind was changed; she spoke again, &ldquo;Give up this superhuman form and indulge in childish sports, which are so dear to a mother&rsquo;s heart; the joy that comes from such sports is unequalled in everyway.&rdquo; Hearing these words the all-wise Lord of immortals became an infant and began to cry. Those who sing this lay (says Tulasīdāsa) attain to the abode of Śrī Hari and never fall into the well of mundane existence.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bipra dhēnu sura saṃta hita līnha manuja avatāra.</h5> <h5>nija icchā nirmita tanu māyā guna gō pāra..192.. [1-192]</h5> <p>For the sake of Brāhmaṇas, cows, gods and saints, the Lord, who transcends Māyā and is beyond the three modes of Prakṛti (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) as well as beyond the reach of the senses took birth as a man assuming a form which is a product of His own will.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>suni sisu rudana parama priya bānī. saṃbhrama cali āī saba rānī..</h5> <h5>haraṣita jahaom tahaom dhāīṃ dāsī. ānaomda magana sakala purabāsī..

[1-192-4]</h5> <p>On hearing the most pleasing sound of the baby&rsquo;s cries all the queens came in a flurry. Maid-servants ran helter-skelter in great delight; all the people of the city were transported with joy. When the tidings of the birth of a son reached Daśaratha&rsquo;s ears he was drowned as it were in the ecstasy of absorption into Brahma. With a mind saturated with the highest love and with a body thrilling all over with joy he sought to rise, while attempting to recover his senses. &ldquo;The same Lord, whose very Name brings blessings with It even when It reaches one&rsquo;s ears, has arrived at my house,&rdquo; he said to himself; and the thought filled his mind with supreme joy. Sending for musicians he said, &ldquo;Play on your instruments. &ldquo;The preceptor Vasiṣṭha was also summoned and he called at the palace door, with a train of Brāhmaṇas. They all went and gazed upon the peerless babe, who was an embodiment of beauty and possessed excellences more than one could tell.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>naṃdīmukha sarādha kari jātakarama saba kīnha.</h5> <h5>hāṭaka dhēnu basana mani nṛpa bipranha kahaom dīnha..193.. [1-193]</h5> <p>After performing the Nāndīmukha Śrāddha* the king completed all the rites connected with the birth of a child and made gifts of gold, cows, raiment and jewels to the Brāhmaṇas.</p> <ul> <li><strong>*</strong> A commemorative offering to the Manes Preliminary to any joyous occasion, such as investiture with the sacred thread, wedding etc. </ul> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>dhvaja patāka tōrana pura chāvā. kahi na jāi jēhi bhāomti banāvā..</h5> <h5>sumanabṛṣṭi akāsa tēṃ hōī. brahmānaṃda magana saba lōī..

[1-193-4]</h5> <p>The city was full of flags and banners and festal arches. It was decorated in a way which defies description. Showers of flowers dropped from heaven; everybody was rapt in the joy of absorption into Brahma. Women streamed forth in troops; they came running in their natural toilet. Carrying jars of gold and salvers full of auspicious articles, they entered the portals of the royal palace singing as they went along. Waving lights and passing offerings round and round over the child&rsquo;s head as an act of exorcism they threw themselves at the babe&rsquo;s feet again and again. Bards, minstrels, panegyrists and songsters chanted solemn praises of the Lord of Raghus. Everyone gave whatever one possessed; even he who received did not retain it. All the lanes of the city were muddy with pastes of musk, sandal and saffron.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>gṛha gṛha bāja badhāva subha pragaṭē suṣamā kaṃda.</h5> <h5>haraṣavaṃta saba jahaom tahaom nagara nāri nara bṛṃda..194.. [1-194]</h5> <p>There was happy music of festivity in every house; for the very fountain of beauty had manifested Himself. All the men and women of the city were full of joy everywhere.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kaikayasutā sumitrā dōū. suṃdara suta janamata bhaiṃ ōū..</h5> <h5>vaha sukha saṃpati samaya samājā. kahi na sakai sārada ahirājā..

[1-194-4]</h5> <p>Kaikeyī and Sumitrā each gave birth to a lovely boy. The joy, grandeur, solemnity of the occasion and the concourse of men were more than what Śāradā and the serpentking could describe. The city of Ayodhyā wore a galla appearance; it looked as if Night had come to see the Lord and, feeling abashed as it were at the sight of the sun (her own lord), had deliberately stayed over in the form of twilight. Clouds of incense represented the dusk; and handfuls of red powder tossed up and wafted in the air represented the redish light of sunset. The hosts of jewels that gleamed on house tops looked like so many stars; while the round pinnacle on the top of the royal palace corresponded to the beautiful moon. The murmuring sound of the chanting of Veda in the palace resembled the chirping of birds appropriate to the occasion. Gazing upon this spectacle the sun for got himself; a whole month passed without his knowing it.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>māsa divasa kara divasa bhā marama na jānai kōi.</h5> <h5>ratha samēta rabi thākēu nisā kavana bidhi hōi..195.. [1-195]</h5> <p>The day assumed the length of a month; but no one could understand the mystery. The sun stood motionless with his chariot; how could there be any night?</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>yaha rahasya kāhū nahiṃ jānā. dina mani calē karata gunagānā..</h5> <h5>dēkhi mahōtsava sura muni nāgā. calē bhavana baranata nija bhāgā..

[1-195-4]</h5> <p>Nobody noticed this strange phenomenon; the sun at last moved ahead singing the praises of Śrī Rāma as he went. Witnessing the great festival the gods, sages and Nāgas proceeded to their several abodes congratulating themselves on their good luck. I tell you one more covert act of Mine; listen to it, O Girijā, for I know your steadfast faith. The sage Kākabhuśuṇḍi and Myself both were there together in human form without anyone knowing it. Elated with supreme joy and the delight of love we roamed about the streets in ecstasy forgetting ourselves. He alone who enjoyed Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s grace could be apprised of this blessed adventure of ours. On that occasion the king granted the desire of everyone&rsquo;s heart, in whatever manner one came. He bestowed elephants, chariots, horses, gold, cows, diamonds and costumes of various kinds</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>mana saṃtōṣē sabanhi kē jahaom tahaom dēhi asīsa.</h5> <h5>sakala tanaya cira jīvahu tulasidāsa kē īsa..196.. [1-196]</h5> <p>All were satisfied in their heart and invoked blessings here and there, saying, &ldquo;May all the sons of Daśaratha live long those Lord of Tulasīdāsa.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kachuka divasa bītē ēhi bhāomtī. jāta na jānia dina aru rātī..</h5> <h5>nāmakarana kara avasaru jānī. bhūpa bōli paṭhaē muni gyānī..

[1-196-4]</h5> <p>A few days rolled on in this way; days and nights passed unnoticed. Knowing that the time had come for naming the children, the king sent for the enlightened sage Vasiṣṭha. After paying him homage the king spoke to him thus, &ldquo;Holy sir! Kindly assign them names that you have fixed your mind upon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Their names are many and unique; yet O king, I will declare them according to my own lights. This eldest boy of yours, who is an ocean of felicity and embodiment of joy, a particle of which fills the three worlds with delight, has for His name &lsquo;Rāma&rsquo;, the very home of bliss and the comforter of all the worlds. Your second son, who sustains and supports the universe, will be called &lsquo;Bharata&rsquo;; while he whose very thought destroys one&rsquo;s enemies is celebrated in the Vedas by the name of Śatrughna&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>lacchana dhāma rāma priya sakala jagata ādhāra.</h5> <h5>guru basiṣṭa tēhi rākhā lachimana nāma udāra..197.. [1-197]</h5> <p>He who is the abode of noble characteristics, the beloved of Śrī Rāma and the mainstay of the whole universe, was given by Guru Vasiṣṭha the splendid name of Lakṣmaṇa.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>dharē nāma gura hṛdayaom bicārī. bēda tatva nṛpa tava suta cārī..</h5> <h5>muni dhana jana sarabasa siva prānā. bāla kēli tēhiṃ sukha mānā..

[1-197-4]</h5> <p>The preceptor assigned these names after careful thought and then said, &ldquo;Your four sons, O king, are the essence of Veda itself. Of them Śrī Rāma is the sages&rsquo; treasure, the devotee&rsquo;s all in all and Śiva&rsquo;s very life; He takes delight at present in the rapture of childish sports&rdquo;. From his earliest days Lakṣmaṇa came to look upon Śrī Rāma as his benefactor and master and conceived devotion to His feet. The love that existed between the two half-brothers, Bharata and Śatrughna, was as glorious as that which obtains between a master and his servant. As the mothers gazed on the beauty of the two lovely pairs, one of whom was dark, the other fair, they would break a blade of grass in order to avert the evil eye. Although all the four brothers were embodiments of amiability, beauty and goodness, yet Śrī Rāma was an ocean of bliss par excellence. In His heart shone the moon of grace and His captivating smile represented its rays. Now on her lap and now in the beautiful cradle, the mother fondled Him calling Him her own darling.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>byāpaka brahma niraṃjana nirguna bigata binōda.</h5> <h5>sō aja prēma bhagati basa kausalyā kē gōda..198.. [1-198]</h5> <p>The unborn and all-pervading Brahma, who is untainted by Māyā, without attributes and devoid of play, has sought shelter in the arms of Kausalyā conquered by her love and devotion.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kāma kōṭi chabi syāma sarīrā. nīla kaṃja bārida gaṃbhīrā..</h5> <h5>aruna carana pakaṃja nakha jōtī. kamala dalanhi baiṭhē janu mōtī..

[1-198-6]</h5> <p>His dark form, which resembles a blue lotus and a heavy rain-cloud, possessed the beauty of millions of Cupids. The nails glistened on His red lotus-like feet as if pearls had been set on the petals of a rosy lotus. Marks of a thunderbolt, a flag and a goad shone on His soles and the tinkling of His anklets enraptured the heart of sages. A string of tiny bells girdled His waist and there were threefolds in His belly; the depth of His navel is known to him alone who has perceived it. His long arms were adorned with a number of ornaments and the tiger&rsquo;s claw hanging on His breast possessed an exquisite beauty. The elegance of the necklace of gems with a diamond at the lowest end and the print of the Brāhmaṇa&rsquo;s foot* fascinated one&rsquo;s mind. His neck resembled a conch-shell in its spiral shape and the chin looked most beautiful; while His face flushed with the beauty of countless Cupids. Pairs of small teeth were veiled by rosy lips and His beautiful nose and the sectarian mark on His brow defied description. With charming ears and most lovely cheeks, His sweet lisping prattle was most delightful to hear. The smooth and curly hair that had never been trimmed since His very birth had been beautifully dressed in manifold ways by the mother. A yellow frock covered His body and His crawling on knees and hands was most pleasing to me. The elegance of His form was something which even the Vedas and Śeṣa (the serpent-god) could not describe; it is known to him alone who has beheld it even in a dream.</p> <ul> <li>Once upon a time there was a discussion among the sages as to which of the three Lords of creation, viz., Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva was the greatest. In order to put the matter to the test Brahmā&rsquo;s son Bhṛgu was deputed to visit the three divinities one by one. Bhṛgu first approached his own father and did not bow to him as a dutiful son. This enraged Brahmā; but he somehow managed to curb his anger by force of reason. From Brahmā&rsquo;s court the sage went to Kailāsa. The god of gods, Śaṅkara, rose to greet the sage and stretched His arms to embrace him. But Bhṛgu avoided His touch saying, &ldquo;Touch me not, since you have broken social conventions and flouted the injunctions of the Vedas.&rdquo; Śiva lost His temper when He heard these aspersions. Taking up His trident He proceeded to strike the sage; but Goddess Pārvatī intervened and pacified Him. Thereafter Bhṛgu went to Vaikuṇṭha, the abode of Bhagavān Viṣṇu, and found the Lord reposing with His head on the lap of Śrī Lakṣmī. Breaking into His room unceremoniously the sage suddenly kicked Him on the chest. The almighty Lord quickly rose with Śrī Lakṣmī, alighted from His bed and, offering him homage, asked his forgiveness for the incivility shown to him by not welcoming him in advance. The Lord then rubbed the sage&rsquo;s foot saying that it might have been hurt by striking against His hard breast. Since then the Lord has ever borne on His bosom the print of the sage&rsquo;s foot as a mark of honour and it stands an abiding monument to His unequalled forbearance. </ul> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sukha saṃdōha mōhapara gyāna girā gōtīta.</h5> <h5>daṃpati parama prēma basa kara sisucarita punīta..199.. [1-199]</h5> <p>The all-blissful Lord, who is above delusion and transcends knowledge, speech and all sensuous perception, sported like an innocent child, yielding to the supreme love of the royal couple (Daśaratha and Kausalyā).</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>ēhi bidhi rāma jagata pitu mātā. kōsalapura bāsinha sukhadātā..</h5> <h5>jinha raghunātha carana rati mānī. tinha kī yaha gati pragaṭa bhavānī..

[1-199-4]</h5> <p>In this way Śrī Rāma, the father and mother of the universe, delighted the people of Ayodhyā. Bhavānī, this demonstrates how those who have conceived devotion to the feet of the Lord of Raghus are repaid by Him. On the other hand, no one can liberate from the bondage of worldly existence him who is averse to the Lord of Raghus, however much he may struggle. Even that Māyā which has held under her sway all living beings, both animate and inanimate, trembles before the Lord, who makes her dance to the play of His eye-brows. Leaving such a lord, tell me, whom should we adore? The Lord of Raghus will compassionate those who betake themselves to Him in thought, word and deed, giving up all cleverness. In this way the Lord sported as a child, to the delight of all the people of the city. The mother would now dandle Him in her arms, and now put Him down and rock Him in the cradle.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>prēma magana kausalyā nisi dina jāta na jāna.</h5> <h5>suta sanēha basa mātā bālacarita kara gāna..200.. [1-200]</h5> <p>Kausalyā remained so rapt in love that days and nights passed unnoticed. Out of affection for her boy she would sing lays of His childhood</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>ēka bāra jananīṃ anhavāē. kari siṃgāra palanāom pauḍhaāē..</h5> <h5>nija kula iṣṭadēva bhagavānā. pūjā hētu kīnha asnānā..

[1-200-4]</h5> <p>One day, mother Kausalyā washed and adorned her boy and put Him to sleep in the cradle. Thereafter she bathed herself in order to worship the patron deity of her family. Having worshipped the deity she offered Him food and then returned to the kitchen. When she came back to the place of worship, she beheld her boy eating the food that had been offered to the Lord. Frightened at this, the mother went to her boy and found Him asleep in the nursery. Coming back once more to the temple she still saw the boy there. She now trembled with fear and her mind found no rest. She saw two boys, one in the temple and the other in the nursery. She said to herself, &ldquo;Is it my mental illusion or some other unusual phenomenon?&rdquo; When Śrī Rāma saw His mother perplexed, the Lord gently smiled.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>dēkharāvā mātahi nija adabhuta rupa akhaṃḍa.</h5> <h5>rōma rōma prati lāgē kōṭi kōṭi brahmaṃḍa.. 201..

[1-201-4]</h5> <p>She saw therein countless suns and moons, Śivas and four-faced Brahmās, and a number of mountains, rivers, oceans, plains and woods, as well as the spirit of time, the principle of action, the modes of Prakṛti (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas), the spirit of knowledge and Nature and many more things of which she had never heard before. She further perceived Māyā, who is powerful in every respect, stricken with terror and standing with her palms joined together. The mother also beheld the embodied soul, who is made to dance by Māyā, and even so the spirit of devotion, which liberates the soul. The hair on the mother&rsquo;s body bristled and she stood speechless. Closing her eyes she bowed her head at the Lord&rsquo;s feet. Seeing the mother struck with wonder the Slayer of Khara assumed the form of a child again. She was unable to utter praises and trembled at the thought that she had looked upon the Father of the universe as her own child. Śrī Hari comforted His mother in many ways and said, &ldquo;Listen, My mother: do not reveal this fact anywhere.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bāra bāra kausalyā binaya karai kara jōri..</h5> <h5>aba jani kabahūom byāpai prabhu mōhi māyā tōri.. 202..

After some time all the four brothers passed the stage of infancy, gladdening the inmates of the house. The preceptor then came and performed the ceremony of tonsure; and the Brāhmaṇas received handsome presents for officiating at the same. All the four noble princes moved about indulging in numerous plays, which were most delightful to look at. The Lord, who cannot be comprehended through mind, speech or action, sported in the courtyard of Daśaratha. When the king, while at dinner, called Him, He would not turn up, loth as he was to leave the company of His playmates. When Kausalyā went to call Him, the Lord would run away toddling. He whom the Vedas declare in negative terms and whose end even Śiva could not find, the mother ran to catch Him by force. With His body besmirched all over with dust, He came and the king smilingly took Him in his arms.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bhōjana karata capala cita ita uta avasaru pāi.</h5> <h5>bhāji calē kilakata mukha dadhi ōdana lapaṭāi..203.. [1-203]</h5> <p>Even while the Lord sat at dinner, His mind was restless, so that the moment He got a chance He would run away hither and thither with a scream of delight, His mouth daubed with curds and rice.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bālacarita ati sarala suhāē. sārada sēṣa saṃbhu śruti gāē..</h5> <h5>jina kara mana inha sana nahiṃ rātā. tē jana baṃcita kiē bidhātā..

[1-203-4]</h5> <p>His charming and most innocent childish sports have been sung by Śāradā, Śeṣa, Śambhu and the Vedas. Those whose mind does not take delight in these have been deprived by Providence of a great good fortune. When all the four brothers attained of boyhood, the preceptor as well as their parents invested them with the sacred thread. The Lord of Raghus then proceeded to His preceptor&rsquo;s residence for study and in a short time mastered all the branches of knowledge. What a great fun that Śrī Hari, whose natural breath stands crystallized in the form of the four Vedas, should go to school. Proficient in learning and perfect in politeness, virtues and decorum, they played all the games imitating the role of a king. With an arrow and bow in the hands of each they appeared most charming; their beauty enraptured the whole creation, both animate and inanimate. Through whichever street the four brothers passed in pursuit of their sport, all the men and women there stood motionless on perceiving them.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kōsalapura bāsī nara nāri bṛddha aru bāla.</h5> <h5>prānahu tē priya lāgata saba kahu rāma kṛpāla..204.. [1-204]</h5> <p>The people of Ayodhyā, men and women, elderly men as well as children, all held the gracious Rāma dearer than life.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>baṃdhu sakhā saṃga lēhiṃ bōlāī. bana mṛgayā nita khēlahiṃ jāī..</h5> <h5>pāvana mṛga mārahiṃ jiyaom jānī. dina prati nṛpahi dēkhāvahiṃ ānī..

[1-204-4]</h5> <p>Calling his half-brothers and playmates Śrī Rāma would take them with Him and go out to the forest for hunting everyday. He would deliberately kill only holy game and brought and showed the daily bag to the king. The beasts that were killed by Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s shaft went straight to heaven after death. He took His meals with His younger brothers and companions and obeyed the orders of His parents. He would always contrive means to delight the people of the city. He would listen to the Vedas and Purāṇas with rapt attention and would Himself expound the truths contained therein to His younger brothers. Rising at break of day the Lord of Raghus would bow His head to His parents and preceptor and, obtaining their permission, busied Himself with the affairs of the city. The king was glad at heart to see His noble acts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-5 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1/37" > <span>Previous (Part -
