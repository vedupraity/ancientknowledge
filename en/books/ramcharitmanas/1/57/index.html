[1-343]</h5> <p>Halting at convenient stages in course of the journey and gladdening the people on the roadside the marriage procession approached Ayodhyā on a sacred day. (343)</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>hanē nisāna panava bara bājē. bhēri saṃkha dhuni haya gaya gājē..</h5> <h5>jhāomjhi birava ḍiṃḍamīṃ suhāī. sarasa rāga bājahiṃ sahanāī..

[1-343-4]</h5> <p>Kettledrums were beaten and good tabors sounded, accompanied by the blast of sackbuts and conchs, and the neighing of horses and trumpeting of elephants. Similarly there was a clash of cymbals and drums, while clarionets played sweet tunes. The citizens were all delighted to hear the procession coming; the hair on their body stood erect. They all decorated their own beautiful houses as well as the markets, streets, squares and gates of the city. All the lanes were watered with perfumes; here and there festal squares were filled in with elegant devices. The bazar was beautified beyond all description with festal arches, flags, banners and canopies. Trees of the areca-nut, the plantain, the mango, the Bakula, the Kadamba and the Tamāla were transplanted alongwith their fruit. The beautiful trees thus planted touched the ground (on account of their being laden with fruits); they had basins of precious stones constructed around them with exquisite skill.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bibidha bhāomti maṃgala kalasa gṛha gṛha racē saomvāri.</h5> <h5>sura brahmādi sihāhiṃ saba raghubara purī nihāri..344.. [1-344]</h5> <p>Festal vases of various kinds were ranged in order in every house; Brahmā and the other gods were filled with envy to see the birthplace of Śrī Rāma (the Chief of Raghus)</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhūpa bhavana tēhi avasara sōhā. racanā dēkhi madana manu mōhā..</h5> <h5>maṃgala saguna manōharatāī. ridhi sidhi sukha saṃpadā suhāī..

[1-344-4]</h5> <p>The king&rsquo;s palace looked very charming on that occasion; its decoration captivated the heart of Cupid himself. It looked as if auspicious omens and loveliness; affluence and mystic powers, joys and smiling prosperity and all kinds of rejoicings had assumed a naturally beautiful form and taken their abode in the palace of King Daśaratha. Tell me who would not feel tempted to have a look at Śrī Rāma and Videha&rsquo;s Daughter? Married women, whose husbands were alive, sallied forth in troops, each eclipsing Love&rsquo;s consort (Rati) by her beauty. They all carried articles of good omen and were equipped with lights for waving round the bridegrooms. As they moved along singing all the way, it appeared as if Goddess Bhāratī (the goddess of speech) had appeared in so many forms. The king&rsquo;s palace was full of hilarious tumult; the joy of the occasion was ineffable. Kausalyā and other mothers of Śrī Rāma were so overwhelmed with emotion that they forgot their own body.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>diē dāna bipranha bipula pūji ganēsa purārī.</h5> <h5>pramudita parama daridra janu pāi padāratha cāri..345.. [1-345]</h5> <p>After worshipping Lord Gaṇeśa and the Slayer of the demon Tripura, they bestowed enormous gifts upon the Brāhmaṇas and were supremely delighted as an utterly indigent man who had attained the four great prizes of life.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>mōda pramōda bibasa saba mātā. calahiṃ na carana sithila bhaē gātā..</h5> <h5>rāma darasa hita ati anurāgīṃ. parichani sāju sajana saba lāgīṃ..

[1-345-4]</h5> <p>All the mothers were so overcome with joy and rapture that their feet refused to walk and all their limbs began to droop as it were. Full of intense longing for a sight of Śrī Rāma they began to get everything ready for the reception of their sons. Music of every kind started playing, while Sumitrā gladly got together articles of good omen such as turmeric, blades of Dūrvā grass, curds, ordinary leaves, flowers, betel-leaves, arecanuts, auspicious roots, unbroken rice, sprouts of barley, Gorocana, parched paddy and lovely blossoms of the Basil plant. Exceedingly charming gold vases, painted with various colours, looked like nests built by Cupid&rsquo;s own birds. Auspicious perfumes defied all description. In this way all the queens prepared all sorts of auspicious articles. They got ready rows of lights arranged in various devices for waving round their sons and with a cheerful heart sang melodious festal strains.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kanaka thāra bhari maṃgalanhi kamala karanhi liēom māta.</h5> <h5>calīṃ mudita parichani karana pulaka pallavita gāta..346.. [1-346]</h5> <p>Carrying in their lotus hands salvers of gold laden with articles of good omen, the queen-mothers proceeded joyfully to greet their sons, every limb of their body throbbing with emotion.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>dhūpa dhūma nabhu mēcaka bhayaū. sāvana ghana ghamaṃḍu janu ṭhayaū..</h5> <h5>surataru sumana māla sura baraṣahiṃ. manahu balāka avali manu karaṣahiṃ..

[1-346-4]</h5> <p>The sky became dark with the fumes of burning incense, as though overhung with the fast gathering clouds of the month of Śrāvaṇa (August). The gods rained down wreaths of flowers from the trees of paradise, which looked like rows of herons in their graceful flight. Lovely festoons made of Jewels looked like rainbows appearing in a row. Charming ladies, appearing on house-tops as quickly as they went out of sight, looked like the fitful flashes of lightning. The beat of drums resembled the crash of thunder; while beggars were as clamorous as the Cātaka birds, frogs and peacocks. The gods poured down showers in the form of sacred perfumes, which gladdened the crop in the form of all the citizens. Perceiving that a propitious hour had arrived the preceptor (Vasiṣṭha) gave the word, and the jewel of Raghu&rsquo;s race, King Daśaratha, gladly entered the city with all his followers, fixing his mind on Bhagavān Śambhu, Goddess Pārvatī and Their son, Lord Gaṇeśa.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>hōhiṃ saguna baraṣahiṃ sumana sura duṃdubhīṃ bajāi.</h5> <h5>bibudha badhū nācahiṃ mudita maṃjula maṃgala gāi..347.. [1-347]</h5> <p>Good omens manifested themselves and the gods rained down flowers to the beat of drums; while celestial dames danced for joy, singing melodious triumphal songs. (347)</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>māgadha sūta baṃdi naṭa nāgara. gāvahiṃ jasu tihu lōka ujāgara..</h5> <h5>jaya dhuni bimala bēda bara bānī. dasa disi sunia sumaṃgala sānī..

[1-347-4]</h5> <p>Bards, minstrels, rhapsodists and skilled dancers chanted the glory of Him (Śrī Rāma) who illumines all the three worlds. Auspicious shouts of victory and the sacred and melodious chanting of the Vedas were heard in all the ten directions. Musical instruments of all kinds began to play; gods in heaven and men in the city were enraptured alike. Members of the bridegroom&rsquo;s party looked smart beyond description. They were highly delighted and could not contain themselves for joy. The people of Ayodhyā then greeted the king, and were gladdened at the very sight of Śrī Rāma. They scattered about Him jewels and vestments; their eyes were full of tears and their body thrilled over. The women of the city gladly waved lights around His head and rejoiced to see the four noble princes. They were all the more gratified when they lifted the curtains of the beautiful palanquins and beheld the brides.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ēhi bidhi sabahī dēta sukhu āē rājaduāra.</h5> <h5>mudita mātu paruchani karahiṃ badhunha samēta kumāra..348.. [1-348]</h5> <p>Thus gladdening the heart of all they arrived at the entrance of the royal palace; the delighted mothers waved lights over the princes and their brides.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>karahiṃ āratī bārahiṃ bārā. prēmu pramōdu kahai kō pārā..</h5> <h5>bhūṣana mani paṭa nānā jātī..karahī nichāvari aganita bhāomtī..

[1-348-4]</h5> <p>They waved lights again and again; the love and rapture which they felt in their heart was beyond all words. They scattered about their sons and daughters-in-law ornaments, jewels and costumes of various kinds and numberless other articles. The queen-mothers were enraptured to behold their four sons alongwith their brides. As they gazed again and again on the beauty of Sītā and Rāma they felt delighted and regarded the object of their life in this world as realized. The queen-mothers&rsquo; companions, as they gazed on Sītā&rsquo;s countenance over and over again, sang and extolled their good fortune. Moment after moment the gods rained down flowers, danced and sang and offered their homage. Seeing the four charming couples Goddess Śāradā ransacked all her stock of similes, but her choice fell on none; they appeared too trivial. She therefore stood gazing with unwinking eyes, enchanted with their beauty</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>nigama nīti kula rīti kari aragha pāomvaḍaē dēta.</h5> <h5>badhunha sahita suta parichi saba calīṃ lavāi nikēta..349.. [1-349]</h5> <p>After performing the rites prescribed by the Vedas or family usage the queenmothers waved lights over all the princes and their brides and conducted them to the palace, offering water to them as a mark of respect and spreading carpets along the way.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>cāri siṃghāsana sahaja suhāē. janu manōja nija hātha banāē..</h5> <h5>tinha para kuaomri kuaomra baiṭhārē. sādara pāya punita pakhārē..

[1-349-4]</h5> <p>There were four exquisitely beautiful thrones, which had been fashioned by Cupid with his own hands as it were; the queen-mothers seated the brides and the bridegrooms on them and reverently laved their holy feet. They then worshipped the blessed couples in accordance with the Vedic ritual by offering them incense, light and oblations of food. They passed lights around them again and again and waved beautiful fans and chowries over their heads. They scattered offerings of various kinds about them; the mothers were as full of exultation as a Yogī who has realized the highest truth, or as a lifelong patient who has been able to lay his hands on nectar or as a born pauper who has stumbled on a philosopher&rsquo;s stone, or as a blind man who has regained a good vision, or as a dumb fellow, whose tongue has been transfused with the eloquence of Śāradā, the goddess of speech, or even as a hero who has triumphed in battle.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ēhi sukha tē sata kōṭi guna pāvahiṃ mātu anaṃdu..</h5> <h5>bhāinha sahita biāhi ghara āē raghukulacaṃdu..350ka..

[1-350(B)]</h5> <p>The mothers derived joy millions of times greater than the joys mentioned above; for in their case it was the Delighter of Raghu&rsquo;s race Himself who had returned home with His brothers duly married. As the mothers performed the traditional rites the brides and their grooms felt shy; while Śrī Rāma smiled within Himself on perceiving the ecstasy and merriment of the occasion.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>dēva pitara pūjē bidhi nīkī. pūjīṃ sakala bāsanā jī kī..</h5> <h5>sabahiṃ baṃdi māgahiṃ baradānā. bhāinha sahita rāma kalyānā..

[1-350(B)-4]</h5> <p>The mothers gratefully worshipped the gods and manes with due ceremony; for all the cravings of their heart had been satisfied. Bowing to all they begged as a boon the welfare of Rāma and His brothers. The gods conferred their blessings all unseen, and the mothers gladly received them by spreading the end of their garment (as a token of respect). The king sent for those who had joined the marriage party and gave them vehicles, wearing apparel, jewels and ornaments. Having received the king&rsquo;s permission and enshrining Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s image in their heart they joyfully returned each to his own house. All the men and women of the city were invested with garments and jewels and there was jubilant music in every home. The king in his exultation gave whatever the mendicants asked for. Every attendant and every musician was sated with gifts and kind attentions.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>dēṃhiṃ asīsa jōhāri saba gāvahiṃ guna gana gātha.</h5> <h5>taba gura bhūsura sahita gṛhaom gavanu kīnha naranātha..351.. [1-351]</h5> <p>They all saluted and invoked blessing upon the king and sang his praises, and thereafter the king, accompanied by his preceptor and other Brāhmaṇas, proceeded to the palace.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>jō basiṣṭha anusāsana dīnhī. lōka bēda bidhi sādara kīnhī..</h5> <h5>bhūsura bhīra dēkhi saba rānī. sādara uṭhīṃ bhāgya baḍa jānī..

[1-351-4]</h5> <p>Under Vasiṣṭha&rsquo;s directions he reverently performed all the ceremonies prescribed either by usage or by the Veda. The queens, on seeing a crowd of Brāhmaṇas, deemed themselves most fortunate and all rose to greet them. They laved the feet of the holy ones and helped them all perform their ablutions; while the king duly worshipped and entertained them at meal. Overwhelmed with the host&rsquo;s civility, gifts and love, they departed glad of heart invoking blessings on him. To Gādhi&rsquo;s son (Viśvāmitra) he paid homage in various ways and said, &ldquo;My lord, there is no one so blessed as I am.&rdquo; The king lavished his praises on him and took the dust of his feet with his queens. He assigned the sage a fine quarter in his own palace, while the king and his whole gynaeceum kept a vigilant eye on his wants even though unexpressed. Again he adored the lotus feet of his preceptor (Vasiṣṭha) and made humble submission to him with great affection in his heart.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>badhunha samēta kumāra saba rāninha sahita mahīsu.</h5> <h5>puni puni baṃdata gura carana dēta asīsa munīsu..352.. [1-352]</h5> <p>All the princes with their brides and the king with his queens bowed to the preceptor&rsquo;s feet again and again, while the great sage invoked blessings on them all.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>binaya kīnhi ura ati anurāgēṃ. suta saṃpadā rākhi saba āgēṃ..</h5> <h5>nēgu māgi munināyaka līnhā. āsirabādu bahuta bidhi dīnhā..

[1-352-4]</h5> <p>With his heart overflowing with love he made entreaties to the Guru and placed his sons and all his wealth before him. The great sage, however, asked for and accepted only his customary due (as a family priest) for the ceremonial occasion and blessed him in profusion. And with the image of Sītā and Rāma installed in his heart he gladly proceeded to his own residence. The king then summoned all the Brāhmaṇa dames, and invested them with beautiful robes, and ornaments. He next sent for the married women of the city (whose husbands were alive and who, though born in Ayodhyā, were married elsewhere) and presented them with garments of their liking. All those who were entitled to receive gifts and presents on ceremonial occasions received their dues from the jewel of kings, who rewarded them according to their choice; and the king duly honoured those guests whom he regarded as worthy of affection and adoration. The gods who witnessed Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s wedding rained down flowers, while applauding the jubilation-</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>calē nisāna bajāi sura nija nija pura sukha pāi.</h5> <h5>kahata parasapara rāma jasu prēma na hṛdayaom samāi..353.. [1-353]</h5> <p>And with beat of drum the celestials gladly proceeded each to his abode, talking to one another of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s glory with their heart overflowing with love.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>saba bidhi sabahi samadi naranāhū. rahā hṛdayaom bhari pūri uchāhū..</h5> <h5>jahaom ranivāsu tahāom pagu dhārē. sahita bahūṭinha kuaomra nihārē..

[1-353-4]</h5> <p>Having shown everyone all possible honour the king, whose heart was overbrimming with joy, visited the private apartments and beheld the princes with their brides. He gladly took the boys in his arms and experienced a thrill of joy which nobody could tell. Similarly he affectionately seated the brides in his lap and fondled them again and again with a heart full of rapture. The ladies of the gynaeceum were delighted to behold this spectacle; the heart of everyone became an abode of joy. The king related how the wedding had taken place and everyone was delighted to hear the account. The goodness, amiability, nobility, loving nature and the splendid wealth of King Janaka were extolled by King Daśaratha in a variety of ways even as a rhapsodist would do; and the queens were enraptured to hear the record of his doings.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sutanha samēta nahāi nṛpa bōli bipra gura gyāti.</h5> <h5>bhōjana kīnha anēka bidhi gharī paṃca gai rāti..354.. [1-354]</h5> <p>After bathing with his sons the king called the Brāhmaṇas, the preceptor and his own kinsmen and, having entertained them at meal, feasted himself on a variety of dishes till a couple of hours of the night passed</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>maṃgalagāna karahiṃ bara bhāmini. bhai sukhamūla manōhara jāmini..</h5> <h5>aomcai pāna saba kāhūom pāē. straga sugaṃdha bhūṣita chabi chāē..

[1-354-4]</h5> <p>Lovely women sang joyous songs, and the night became a source of delight and soul-enchanting. After rinsing their mouth the king and his party were all given betel-leaves; and adorned with garlands and sandal-paste etc., they looked most charming. Looking once more at Śrī Rāma and having received His permission they proceeded each to his own house, bowing their heads to Him. The love and rapture, meriment and magnanimity, prosperity, splendour and loveliness that manifested there were more than could be told by a hundred Śāradās and Śeṣas, Vedas and Brahmās, Śivas and Ganesas. How, then, can I describe them at length any more than an earthly serpent could support the globe on its head? The king then summoned the queens and, showing every honour to them all, admonished them in gentle tones. &ldquo;The brides are yet damsels and have come to a strange house; therefore, take care of them as eyelids protect the eyes.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>larikā śramita unīda basa sayana karāvahu jāi.</h5> <h5>asa kahi gē biśrāmagṛhaom rāma carana citu lāi..355.. [1-355]</h5> <p>The boys are tired and feeling drowsy; go and put them to bed.&rdquo; So saying he retired to his own bedroom with his mind fixed on Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhūpa bacana suni sahaja suhāē. jarita kanaka mani palaomga ḍasāē..</h5> <h5>subhaga surabhi paya phēna samānā. kōmala kalita supētīṃ nānā..

[1-355-4]</h5> <p>Hearing the sweet and loving words of the king, the queens made ready bejewelled beds of gold and furnished them with many a rich covering, soft and white as the froth of cow&rsquo;s milk, and pillows more charming than words can tell. The bed-chamber, made of precious stones, was decked with garlands and supplied with perfumes, lamps consisting of bright gems and a canopy lovely beyond words. He alone who saw it could know what it was like. Having thus prepared a number of fine beds the queens took up Śrī Rāma and lovingly laid Him down upon one of them. On being repeatedly asked by Śrī Rāma, His brothers too retired each to his own bed. As the mothers gazed on the swarthy limbs of Śrī Rāma, so soft and attractive, they all exclaimed in loving accents, &ldquo;How did you manage, dear child; to kill the most dreadful demoness Tāḍakā while on your way to the forest?</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>ghōra nisācara bikaṭa bhaṭa samara ganahiṃ nahiṃ kāhu..</h5> <h5>mārē sahita sahāya kimi khala mārīca subāhu..356.. [1-356]</h5> <p>How were you able to slay those monstrous giants, the wicked Mārīca and Subāhu and their followers, who were formidable warriors and counted none before them in battle?&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>muni prasāda bali tāta tumhārī. īsa anēka karavarēṃ ṭārī..</h5> <h5>makha rakhavārī kari duhu bhāī. guru prasāda saba bidyā pāī..

[1-356-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;I offer myself, dear child, as a sacrifice for your sake; it was through the goodwill of the sage Viśvāmitra alone that God kept away a number of calamities from you. Even while you and your brother (Lakṣmaṇa) guarded the sacrifice, you were initiated into all the secret lore. At the mere touch of the dust from your feet the hermit&rsquo;s wife (Ahalyā) attained salvation and your glory filled the whole universe. In the assembly of princes you broke Śiva bow, hard though it was as a tortoise-shell or adamant or rock. You gained the glory of having triumphed over the world and won the hand of Janaka&rsquo;s daughter, and then returned home after marrying all your brothers. All your actions have been superhuman and were accomplished only by the grace of the sage Kauśika. Our birth into the world has borne fruit today as we now behold, dear child, your moon-like face. Our prayer is that the number of days that have been spent without seeing you, may not be reckoned by the Creator at all.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>rāma pratōṣīṃ mātu saba kahi binīta bara baina.</h5> <h5>sumiri saṃbhu gura bipra pada kiē nīdabasa naina..357.. [1-357]</h5> <p>Śrī Rāma gratified all His mothers by addressing sweet and polite words to them; and fixing His thought on the feet of Lord Śambhu, His preceptors (Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra) and the Brāhmaṇas in general, He closed His eyes in order to sleep.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>nīdau badana sōha suṭhi lōnā. manahu sāomjha sarasīruha sōnā..</h5> <h5>ghara ghara karahiṃ jāgarana nārīṃ. dēhiṃ parasapara maṃgala gārīṃ..

[1-357-4]</h5> <p>Even during sleep His most charming countenance gleamed as a red lotus, half closed at eventide. In every house women kept vigil and railed at one another in auspicious strains. The queens said to one another, &ldquo;See, friends, how resplendent the city is, and how splendid the night!&rdquo; The mothers-in-law then slept with the lovely brides enfolded in their arms even as serpents would clasp to their bosom the gems from their hood. At the holy hour before dawn the Lord awoke, and the cocks commenced their beautiful crowing. The rhapsodists and genealogists sang His praises, while the citizens flocked to the gate to make their obeisance. The four brothers saluted the Brāhmaṇas and gods as well as their preceptor and parents and were glad to receive their benedictions. The mothers reverently gazed on their countenance as the princes repaired to the gate with the king.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kīnha sauca saba sahaja suci sarita punīta nahāi.</h5> <h5>prātakriyā kari tāta pahiṃ āē cāriu bhāi..358.. [1-358]</h5> <p>Though pure in themselves, the four brothers performed all the purificatory acts (such as evacuating the bowels, cleansing the privates and the hands with water and clay, rinsing the mouth, brushing the teeth and cleansing the tongue etc.,) and bathed in the holy river (Sarayū) and, having gone through their morning routine of prayer etc., returned to their sire.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhūpa bilōki liē ura lāī. baiṭhai haraṣi rajāyasu pāī..</h5> <h5>dēkhi rāmu saba sabhā juḍaānī. lōcana lābha avadhi anumānī..

[1-358-4]</h5> <p>The king, on seeing them, clasped them to his bosom; and the four brothers gladly sat down on receiving his permission. The whole court was gratified to see Rāma and accounted their eyes supremely blest. Then came the sages Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra and were seated on splendid seats. The father and sons adored the sages and clasped their feet and the two preceptors were enraptured to behold Śrī Rāma. The sage Vasiṣṭha narrated sacred legends, while the king and the ladies of the gynaeceum listened. In the course of his narration the sage gladly recounted in diverse ways the doings of Viśvāmitra, that surpassed the imagination even of hermits. Vāmadeva (another family preceptor of King Daśaratha) observed that whatever Vasiṣṭha said was true and that Viśvāmitra&rsquo;s fair renown had pervaded all the three spheres. Everyone rejoiced to hear that, while Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were all the more delighted at heart.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>maṃgala mōda uchāha nita jāhiṃ divasa ēhi bhāomti.</h5> <h5>umagī avadha anaṃda bhari adhika adhika adhikāti..359.. [1-359]</h5> <p>There was constant felicity, joy and rejoicing and days rolled on in this way. The city of Ayodhyā was inundated with a tidal wave of delight, swelling higher and still higher</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sudina sōdhi kala kaṃkana chaurē. maṃgala mōda binōda na thōrē..</h5> <h5>nita nava sukhu sura dēkhi sihāhīṃ. avadha janma jācahiṃ bidhi pāhīṃ..

[1-359-5]</h5> <p>After fixing on auspicious day the sacred strings (tied round the wrist of the brides and bridegrooms before the wedding for warding off evil-spirits) were united with no little felicity, joy and merriment. The gods were filled with envy to see new rejoicings everyday and begged of the Creator that they might be born in Ayodhyā. Viśvāmitra intended leaving everyday, but was detained by Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s affectionate entreaties. Seeing the king&rsquo;s devotion to him grow a hundredfold day after day the great sage Viśvāmitra was full of praise for him. At last when he asked permission to go, the king was greatly moved and with his sons stood before him saying, &ldquo;My lord, all that I have is yours; while I and my sons and wives are your servants. Be ever gracious to these boys and condescend from time to time to bless me with your sight.&rdquo; So saying, the king with his sons and queens fell at his feet, and speech failed his tongue. The Brāhmaṇa (Viśvāmitra) invoked upon him every kind of blessing and departed amidst a scene of love that defied all description. Śrī Rāma and all His brothers lovingly escorted him and returned only when they were allowed to go back.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-5 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1/56" > Previous (Part - 56) </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1/58" > Next (Part - 58) </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>1 - Baal Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/1/57"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part - 57</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-title> Select language </swal-title> <swal-input type=select  value=hi  /> <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script> window.redirectTo = function(url) { window.location.href = url; } window.languageSelector = async () => { const { value: language } = await Swal.fire({ template: '#language-selector-swal-template' }) if (language) { if (window.location.pathname === '/') { window.redirectTo(`/${language}/`); } else { let currentPath = window.location.pathname; let newPath = currentPath.replace(/^\/[a-z]{2}\/?/, `/${language}/`); window.redirectTo(newPath); } } }; </script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
