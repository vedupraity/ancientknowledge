[3-9-12]</h5> <p>The sage Agastya had a learned disciple, Sutīkṣṇa by name, who was a great lover of the Lord. He was devoted to Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s feet in thought, word and deed and had no faith in any other deity even in dream. As soon as the news of the Lord&rsquo;s approach reached his ears he rushed out hurriedly, indulging in his own fancy: &ldquo;Will the Lord of Raghus, the befriender of the meek, O good heavens, ever show His grace to a wretch like me? Will Lord Śrī Rāma and His younger brother receive me as their own servant? I have no unswerving faith in my heart nor is my mind illumined by the light of devotion, dispassion or wisdom. I have no association with saints and practise neither Yoga (concentration of mind) nor Japa (muttering of prayers), nor the ritual. Nor do I claim any steadfast devotion to the Lord&rsquo;s lotus feet. I bank on one characteristic of the all-merciful Lord; He holds the devotee dear who depends exclusively on Him. This inspires me with the hope that my eyes will be rewarded today by the sight of the Lord&rsquo;s lotus face, that delivers one from the bondage of worldly existence.&rdquo; The wise was drowned in a flood of love; his condition. O Pārvatī, cannot be described in words. He had no idea of the four quarters, much less of the intermediate points of the compass; nor could he make out the track. He did not know who he was or whither bound. He would now turn back and then resume his journey in the same direction; and now he would dance and sing songs of praise. The sage had been gifted with devotion of the nature of intense love and the Lord watched him hiding behind a tree. When the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line, who dispels the fear of transmigration, saw the sage&rsquo;s excessive love, He revealed Himself in his heart. The sage sat motionless in the middle of the road, his body bristling like a jack-fruit with its hair standing on end. The Lord of Raghus thereupon drew near and was delighted at heart to see the state of His devotee. Śrī Rāma tried many ways to rouse the sage; but he would not wake, lost as he was in the ecstasy of his vision. Śrī Rāma then withdrew His kingly guise and manifested His fourarmed form in the sage&rsquo;s heart. The sage thereupon started up in great agony, growing as restless as a noble serpent that has lost the gem on its head. But seeing before him the blissful Rāma in His swarthy form with Sītā and His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa), the great and blessed sage was overwhelmed with affection and dropped like a log at His feet. Taking him in His long arms the Lord lifted him and with utmost affection pressed him to His bosom. While embracing the sage the gracious Lord shone forth like a Tamāla tree meeting a tree of gold. The sage gazed on Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s face standing motionless like a figure drawn in a picture.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>taba muni hṛdayaom dhīra dhīra gahi pada bārahiṃ bāra.</h5> <h5>nija āśrama prabhu āni kari pūjā bibidha prakāra..10.. [3-10]</h5> <p>Summoning courage in his heart and clasping His feet again and again the sage then conducted the Lord to his hermitage and offered Him homage in many ways</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kaha muni prabhu sunu binatī mōrī. astuti karauṃ kavana bidhi tōrī..</h5> <h5>mahimā amita mōri mati thōrī. rabi sanmukha khadyōta aomjōrī..

For immeasurable is Your glory and scant my wit, which is as insignificant as the flash of a fire-fly before the sun. I constantly glorify Śrī Rāma (the Chief of Raghus), with a body dark as a string of blue lotuses, wearing a crown of matted locks on His head and clad in a hermit&rsquo;s robes, and carrying a bow and arrow in His hands with a quiver fastened to His waist. The fire which consumes the thick forest of delusion, the sun that brings delight to the lotus-like saints, the lion who kills the herd of elephants in the form of demons, the hawk that kills the bird of metempsychosis, may He ever protect us. I extol Śrī Rāma, whose eyes resemble the red lotus, who is elegantly dressed, who is a full moon to Sītā&rsquo;s Cakora like eyes, who is a cygnet disporting in the Mānasa lake of Lord Śiva heart and who has a broad chest and long arms. A Garuḍa to devour the serpent of doubt, the queller of despair induced by heated controversy, the uprooter of transmigration, the delighter of gods, the embodiment of compassion, may He ever protect us, I sing the praises of Śrī Rāma, the reliever of earth&rsquo;s burden, who is both with and without attributes, who is partial as well as impartial, who transcends knowledge, speech and the senses and has no compeer, nay, who is all-pure, all-comprehensive, faultless and unlimited. A veritable garden of wish-yielding trees to His devotees, who keeps away wrath, greed, pride and lust, who is most urbane in manners and the bridge to cross the ocean of mundane existence, may that champion of the solar race ever protect me. Matchless in power of arm, the home of strength, the armour for the protection of righteousness, endowed with a host of delightful virtues, may that Rāma whose very Name wipes out the greatest sins of the Kali age, be ever propitious to me. Even though He is passionless, all-pervading, imperishable and ever dwelling in the heart of all, let Him abide in my thoughts as the Slayer of Khara roaming about in the woods with His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) and Sītā. Let alone, my lord, those who know You to be both with and without attributes and the witness of all hearts. As for myself may Śrī Rāma, the lotus-eyed Lord of Kosala, take up His abode in my heart. Let not this exalted feeling disappear from my mind even in an unguarded moment that I am His servant and the Lord of Raghus my master.&rdquo; Śrī Rāma was delighted at heart to hear the sage&rsquo;s words, and in His delight He pressed the great sage to His bosom again. &ldquo;Know Me to be supremely pleased, O sage; I am prepared to grant you any boon you may choose to ask.&rdquo; The sage replied, &ldquo;I have never asked any boon and know not what is real and what unreal (what to choose and what to reject). Therefore, O Delighter of Your devotees, grant me that which pleases You, O Lord of Raghus.&rdquo; &ldquo;May you become a repository of worldly wisdom and goodness as well as of intense devotion, dispassion and spiritual wisdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have received the boon that my Lord has been pleased to grant. Now vouchsafe to me that which is cherished by me.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>anuja jānakī sahita prabhu cāpa bāna dhara rāma.</h5> <h5>mama hiya gagana iṃdu iva basahu sadā nihakāma..11.. [3-11]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Armed with a bow and arrow and accompanied by Your younger brother and Janaka&rsquo;s Daughter (Sītā), O Lord Śrī Rāma, pray dwell forever like a moon in the firmament of my heart, though free from every desire.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>ēvamastu kari ramānivāsā. haraṣi calē kubhaṃja riṣi pāsā..</h5> <h5>bahuta divasa gura darasana pāēom. bhaē mōhi ēhiṃ āśrama āēom..

[3-11-7]</h5> <p>So be it, &ldquo;said Śrī Rāma ( the Abode of Lakṣmī) as He joyously started on His visit to the jar-born sage, Agastya. &ldquo;It is a long time since I last saw my Guru and came to live in this hermitage. Now, my lord, I will go with You to see my Guru; thus I am not putting You under any obligation.&rdquo; The Fountain of Mercy saw through the sage&rsquo;s cleverness and both the brothers smiled as they took him with them. Discoursing on the way on the incomparable cult of devotion to His own feet Śrī Rāma (the King of the gods) arrived at the hermitage of the sage ( Agastya). Sutīkṣṇa immediately saw his Guru and after prostrating himself before the latter thus addressed him, &ldquo;My lord, the two sons of King Daśaratha (Kosala&rsquo;s lord), the support of the world, have come to see you-Śrī Rāma, accompanied by His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) and Videha&rsquo;s Daughter (Sītā), whose Name you repeat night and day, venerable sir.&rdquo; Agastya started up as soon as he heard this and ran; at the sight of Śrī Hari his eyes filled with tears. The two brothers fell at the sage&rsquo;s lotus feet; but the sage took and clasped them to his bosom with the utmost affection. Courteously enquiring after their welfare the enlightened sage conducted them to an exalted seat and then offered worship in various ways to the Lord, saying &ldquo;There is no other man so blessed as I am.&rdquo; Whatever other sages had assembled there, were all delighted to behold the Fountain of Joy.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>muni samūha mahaom baiṭhē sanmukha saba kī ōra.</h5> <h5>sarada iṃdu tana citavata mānahu nikara cakōra..12.. [3-12]</h5> <p>As He sat in the midst of the assembly of sages with His face turned towards all (and their eyes fixed on His moon-like face), they seemed like a bevy of Cakora birds gazing on the autumnal moon.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>taba raghubīra kahā muni pāhīṃ. tumha sana prabhu durāva kachu nāhī..</h5> <h5>tumha jānahu jēhi kārana āyau. tātē tāta na kahi samujhāyau..

[3-12-9]</h5> <p>Then said Śrī Rāma (the Hero of Raghu&rsquo;s line) to the sage, &rdquo; I have nothing to hide from you, my lord. You know what for I have come; that is why, holy father, I have not dwelt at length on this point. Now, my good sir, give me some advice, by following which I may be able to kill the enemies of the hermits.&rdquo; The sage smiled when he heard the Lord&rsquo;s remarks. &ldquo;With what intention have You asked me this question? It is by virtue of my devotion to You, O Destroyer of sins, that I know a bit of Your glory. Your Māyā (Creative Energy) is like a huge tree of the species known by the name of Udumbara, with the countless multitudes of universes for its clustering fruits. The animate and inanimate beings (inhabiting the various universes) are like the insects that dwell inside the fruits and know of no other fruit (besides the one they inhabit ). The relentless and dreadful Time-spirit devours these fruits; but even that (all-devouring) Time ever trembles in fear of You. You, who are the suzerain lord of all the regional lords, have asked my advice as though You were an ordinary human being. I ask this boon of You, O Home of mercy: pray dwell in my heart with Your Spouse (Sītā) and younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) and let me have intense devotion, dispassion, fellowship with the saints and unbroken love for Your lotus feet. Even though I know You to be the same as the indivisible and infinite Brahma (the Absolute), who can only be realized ( and cannot be known by any other means) and is adored by the saints, and even though I depict You as such, I feel enamoured of Your qualified form again and again. You have always exalted Your servants; that is why You have thought fit to consult me, O Lord of Raghus. There is, my lord, a most charming and holy spot; it is called Pañcavaṭī. Sanctify the Daṇḍaka forest (where it is situated) and redeem it from the terrible curse of the great sage (Śukrācārya). Take up Your abode there, O Lord of Raghu&rsquo;s line, and show Your grace to all the sages.&rdquo; On receiving the sage&rsquo;s permission Śrī Rāma departed and drew near to Pañcavaṭī in no time.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-5 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/3/5" > Previous (Part - 5) </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/3/7" > Next (Part - 7) </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/3"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>3 - Aranya Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/3/6"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part - 6</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-title> Select language </swal-title> <swal-input type=select  value=hi  /> <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script type="application/javascript"> window.redirectTo = (url) => { window.location.href = url; }; window.languageSelector = async () => { const { value: language } = await Swal.fire({ template: '#language-selector-swal-template' }); if (language) { if (window.location.pathname === '/') { window.redirectTo(`/${language}/`); } else { let currentPath = window.location.pathname; let newPath = currentPath.replace(/^\/[a-z]{2}\/?/, `/${language}/`); window.redirectTo(newPath); }; }; }; </script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
