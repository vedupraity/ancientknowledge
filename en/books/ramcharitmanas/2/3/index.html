[2-12]</h5> <p>Now Kaikeyī (Bharata&rsquo;s mother) had a dull-witted servant-maid, Mantharā by name; having perverted her reason and making her a receptacle of ill-repute, the goddess of speech returned to her abode.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>dīkha maṃtharā nagaru banāvā. maṃjula maṃgala bāja badhāvā..</h5> <h5>pūchēsi lōganha kāha uchāhū. rāma tilaku suni bhā ura dāhū..

[2-12-4]</h5> <p>Mantharā saw the city decorated and festal music melodiously playing; she, therefore, asked the people, &ldquo;What is all this rejoicing about?&rdquo; When she heard of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s coming installation, she felt distressed in her heart. That evil-minded and low- born woman pondered how mischief might be created overnight, even as a wily Bhīla woman who has seen a honeycomb hanging from a tree schemes how to get hold of the honey. Pulling a long face she approached Bharata&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;What makes you look so grave?&rdquo; the queen smilingly asked. She made no answer, but only heaved a deep sigh, and adopting the way of women shed crocodile tears. Said the queen laughing, &ldquo;You are a most saucy girl; what I suspect, therefore, is that Lakṣmaṇa has taught you a lesson.&rdquo; Even then the most wicked servant-maid would not speak and merely hissed like a cobra. (1-4)</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>sabhaya rāni kaha kahasi kina kusala rāmu mahipālu.</h5> <h5>lakhanu bharatu ripudamanu suni bhā kubarī ura sālu..13.. [2-13]</h5> <p>Apprehensive of mischief, the queen said to her, &ldquo;How is it that you do not speak? I hope Rāma and his royal father, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Ripudamana (Śatrughna) are all well?&rdquo; The hump backed woman (Mantharā) was pained at heart to hear these words.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kata sikha dēi hamahi kōu māī. gālu karaba kēhi kara balu pāī..</h5> <h5>rāmahi chāḍai kusala kēhi ājū. jēhi janēsu dēi jubarājū..

[2-13-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Why should anyone, O mother, give me a lesson? And on whose strength shall I be cheeky? Who is happy today, except Rāma, whom the king is going so invest with regal powers? Providence has turned most favourable to Kausalyā; seeing this she cannot contain the pride of her bosom. Why not go and se for yourself all the splendour, the sight of which has agitated my mind? Your son is away; while you are complacent under the notion that your lord is under your thumb. You are excessively fond of sleeping on a cushioned bed and are unable to detect the deceitful cunning of the king.&rdquo; Hearing these affectionate words, yet knowing her malicious mind the queen angrily said, &ldquo;Keep quiet now. If you ever speak thus again, expert as you are in sowing seeds of discord in a family, I will have your tongue pulled out.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kānē khōrē kūbarē kuṭila kucālī jāni.</h5> <h5>tiya bisēṣi puni cēri kahi bharatamātu musukāni..14.. [2-14]</h5> <p>&ldquo;The one-eyed, the lame and the hump-backed, know these to be perverse and wicked, more so if they come of women folk and particularly those belonging to the menial class!&rdquo; said Bharata&rsquo;s mother and smiled.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>priyabādini sikha dīnhiu tōhī. sapanēhu tō para kōpu na mōhī..</h5> <h5>sudinu sumaṃgala dāyaku sōī. tōra kahā phura jēhi dina hōī..

[2-14-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;O sweet-tongued girl, I have said all this to you by way of advice; otherwise I cannot even dream of being angry with you. That day alone will be auspicious and a bestower of good fortune, when your words will come to be true. The eldest brother should be the lord and the younger ones his servants: such is the blessed custom prevailing in the solar race. If Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s inauguration is really taking place tomorrow, ask of me, my friend, what pleases your mind and I will grant it. By his innate disposition Rāma loves all his mothers as dearly as Kausalyā. He is particularly fond of me; I have had occasions to test his love. Should God in His mercy vouchsafe to me a human birth again, may Rāma and Sītā be my son and daughter-in-law respectively. Rāma is dearer to me than life; how is it that you have got perturbed at the news of his inauguration?&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bharata sapatha tōhi satya kahu parihari kapaṭa durāu.</h5> <h5>haraṣa samaya bisamau karasi kārana mōhi sunāu..15.. [2-15]</h5> <p>&ldquo;I adjure you in Bharata&rsquo;s name to tell me the truth putting away all deceit and reservation. Let me know the reason why you should grieve on an occasion of rejoicing.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>ēkahiṃ bāra āsa saba pūjī. aba kachu kahaba jībha kari dūjī..</h5> <h5>phōrai jōgu kapāru abhāgā. bhalēu kahata dukha raurēhi lāgā..

[2-15-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;I have had all my ambitions fulfilled as a result of my speaking only once; I shall now speak again with another tongue. My wretched head surely deserves to be smashed since you get offended even at my well-meaning words. Those alone who speak unctuous words, minding not what is true and what is false, are your favourites, while I am disagreeable to you. From this day onward I too will utter only that which is palatable to my mistress, or else will keep mum all the twenty-four hours. God has given me a misshapen body and made me dependent on others; one must reap as one has sown and must get what one has given. Whoever may be the ruler, I lose nothing thereby; for shall I cease to be a servant and become a queen now? Damnable is my nature in that I cannot bear to see harm come to you. That is why I just broached the topic. But it was a great blunder on my part; therefore, pardon me, O venerable lady.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>gūḍha kapaṭa priya bacana suni tīya adharabudhi rāni.</h5> <h5>suramāyā basa bairinihi suhda jāni patiāni..16.. [2-16]</h5> <p>Hearing these pregnant and agreeably deceitful words, the queen, who was a woman with an unstable mind and was dominated by the celestial Māyā, reposed her faith in an enemy mistaking her for a friend.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sādara puni puni pūomchati ōhī. sabarī gāna mṛgī janu mōhī..</h5> <h5>tasi mati phirī ahai jasi bhābī. rahasī cēri ghāta janu phābī..

[2-16-4]</h5> <p>Again and again the queen politely questioned Mantharā, hyptonized as she was by the latter&rsquo;s guileful words like a doe fascinated by the music of a Bhīla woman. Her mind was changed according to the decree of fate and the servant-maid was pleased to find her plan succeed. She replied, &ldquo;While you persist in questioning me, I am afraid to open my lips, since you have given me the name of a mischief-maker.&rdquo; Thus working up the queen&rsquo;s faith and manipulating her according to her own liking in everyway, Mantharā, who spelt disaster for Ayodhyā like the evil influence exerted by the planet Saturn for a period of seven and a half years (according to Indian Astrology), then spoke, &ldquo;You said just now, O queen, that Sītā and Rāma were dear to you and that you had endeared yourself to Rāma; this assertion of yours is true. This is, however, a thing of the past; those days have now gone by. When the tide turns even friend become foes. The sun fosters the family of lotuses; but in the absence of water it burns them to ashes. Your co-wife (Kausalyā) would strike at your very root; protect it by means of a good fence in the form of a remedy.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>tumhahi na sōcu sōhāga bala nija basa jānahu rāu.</h5> <h5>mana malīna muha mīṭha nṛpa rāura sarala subhāu..17.. [2-17]</h5> <p>&ldquo;You are free from anxiety on the strength of your husband&rsquo;s love and know him to be under your sway. The king, however, is malicious of mind, though sweet of tongue; while you possess a guileless nature.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>catura gaombhīra rāma mahatārī. bīcu pāi nija bāta saomvārī..</h5> <h5>paṭhaē bharatu bhūpa naniaurēṃ. rāma mātu mata jānava raurēṃ..

[2-17-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Rāma&rsquo;s mother (Kausalyā) is clever and deep; finding a suitable opportunity she has turned it to account. You must know it is at the suggestion of Rāma&rsquo;s mother that the king has sent away Bharata to his maternal grandfather&rsquo;s. She says to herself, &ldquo;All my other co-wives serve me well, only Bharata&rsquo;s mother (yourself) is proud, because of her influence with her lord. It is therefore, O mother, that you rankle in Kausalyā&rsquo;s heart; but she is too crafty to disclose her mind. The king is particularly fond of you; but due to the jealousy to which a co-wife is naturally subject, Kausalyā cannot tolerate it. That is why by resorting to machination and winning over the king she has prevailed on him to fix a date for Rāma&rsquo;s installation on the throne. The inauguration of Rāma is in accord with the traditions of the family; it is liked by all and is quite to my taste. I, however, shudder to think of the consequences; may heaven so ordain that the mischief may recoil on her own head.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>raci paci kōṭika kuṭilapana kīnhēsi kapaṭa prabōdhu..</h5> <h5>kahisi kathā sata savati kai jēhi bidhi bāḍha birōdhu..18.. [2-18]</h5> <p>Inventing and injecting many a mischievous formula Mantharā put the queen of the scent and told her a hundred and one stories of co-wives so as to foment her jealousy.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhāvī basa pratīti ura āī. pūomcha rāni puni sapatha dēvāī..</h5> <h5>kā pūchahu tumha abahu na jānā. nija hita anahita pasu pahicānā..

[2-18-4]</h5> <p>As fate would have it, the queen felt assured in her heart of Mantharā&rsquo;s fidelity; adjuring her by her own life she questioned Mantharā once more, &ldquo;What is it that you inquire about? It is strange that you should not understand things even now! Even a quadruped knows what is good or bad for it. Preparations have been going on for the last fortnight; while you have got the news from me today. I get food and clothing under your tutelage; hence I cannot be blamed for speaking the truth. If I tell a lie giving it the colour of truth, God will punish me for the same. Should Rāma&rsquo;s inauguration take place tomorrow, God will have sown the seed of adversity for you. I swear and tell you most emphatically, O lady, that you have been discarded now as a fly from a cup of milk. If you and your son accept the role of servants, then alone you will be allowed to stay in the house; and in no other circumstance.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>kadrūom binatahi dīnha dukhu tumhahi kausilāom dēba.</h5> <h5>bharatu baṃdigṛha sēihahiṃ lakhanu rāma kē nēba..19.. [2-19]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Kadrū (the progenitress of the serpent race) persecuted her co-wife Vinatā* (mother of the whole feathered kingdom); so will Kausalyā tyrannize over you. Bharata will rot in prison, while Lakṣmaṇa will be Rāma&rsquo;s lieutenant.&rdquo;</p> <ul> <li><strong>*</strong> The names Kadrū and Vinatā take us back to the beginning of creation. The Purāṇas (a class of sacred literature dealing with the history of the entire cosmos and wrongly supposed by modern critics both in India and abroad to be works on mythology) declare that the different species of living beings from celestials down to the tiniest insect took their common descent from the sage Kaśyapa through different mothers. Of them Kadrū gave birth to the race of serpents, while Vinatā brought forth the winged creation. Once there was a controversy between the two ladies about the colour of the tail of the celestial horse Uccaiḥśravā. Vinatā insisted that the horse was white in colour while Kadrū maintained that it was dark. It was mutually agreed that the lady whose version proved untrue should serve the other as a handmaid for the rest of her life. When Kadrū came to know that the horses were really white in colour, she managed to hoodwink the guileless Vinatā by asking her sons (the cobra race) to cover the tail of Uccaiḥśravā by their own dark forms and thus lending it a dark hue. Vinatā was thus made to serve her co-wife for a number of years and suffered great persecution at her hands, till she was liberated by Garuḍa (Vinatā&rsquo;s powerful son and the celebrated vehicle of Bhagavān Viṣṇu). The story is told at length in the Ādiparva of the Mahābhārata. </ul> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>kaikayasutā sunata kaṭu bānī. kahi na sakai kachu sahami sukhānī..</h5> <h5>tana pasēu kadalī jimi kāompī. kubarīṃ dasana jībha taba cāompī..

[2-19-4]</h5> <p>Hearing these unpleasant remarks, Kekaya&rsquo;s daughter (Kaikeyī) shrivelled with fear and could not utter a word. Her body was wet with perspiration and shook like a plantain stalk. The humpback then bit her tongue (for fear lest the gloomy picture drawn by her might break Kaikeyī&rsquo;s heart). Telling her one after another many a story of wiles Mantharā comforted the queen and asked her to be of good cheer. At last the tide turned and Kaikeyī conceived a fondness for mischief; she applauded a heron mistaking it for a swan. &ldquo;Listen, O Mantharā; what you say is quite true. My right eye ever throbs and I have an evil dream every night; but in my folly I did not tell you. I cannot help it, my friend; I am so guileless by nature. I cannot distinguish a friend from a foe.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>apanē calata na āju lagi anabhala kāhuka kīnha.</h5> <h5>kēhiṃ agha ēkahi bāra mōhi daiaom dusaha dukhu dīnha..20..

For him whom heaven allows so survive as a dependant of an enemy, death is preferable to life.&rdquo; The queen uttered many such words of despondency; at this the humpback resorted to the wily ways of a woman. &ldquo;Why should you speak in this strain, indulging in self-depreciation? Your happiness and good-luck will be ever on the increase. Whoever has contemplated such gross mischief to you shall eventually reap its fruit. Ever since I heard of this plot, my lady, I have felt no appetite during the day and have had no wink of sleep at night. I consulted the astrologers and they declared in positive terms: &lsquo;Bharata shall be the king; this much is certain.&rsquo; If you act up to it, O good lady, I will offer a suggestion to you; the king is under an obligation to you.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>parau kūpa tua bacana para sakau pūta pati tyāgi.</h5> <h5>kahasi mōra dukhu dēkhi baḍa kasa na karaba hita lāgi..21..

[2-21-4]</h5> <p>Winning over Kaikeyī and treating her as an offering accepted for sacrifice the humpback whetted the knife of trickery on the stone of her heart. The queen, however, like a sacrificial beast who nibbled the green turf, did not foresee the impending calamity. Agreeable to hear, yet painful in consequence, were the words she spoke; it seemed as if she was administering honey mixed with poison. Said the maid-servant, &ldquo;Do you, or do you not, remember the incident you once told me, my lady? You have in reserve with the king a couple of boons that he once promised you.* Ask for them today and soothe your heart. Bestow sovereignty on your son and an abode in the forest on Rāma and rob your co-wives of all their joy. When the king swears by Rāma, ask the boons only then, so that the former may not go back upon his word. The scheme will fail if this night is allowed to pass; cherish my words as dearer than life.&rdquo;</p> <ul> <li><strong>*</strong> It is stated in Vālmīki&rsquo;s Rāmāyaṇa that King Daśaratha was once engaged in a combat with the demon king Śambara on behalf of the gods. The king was mortally wounded and fell unconscious in his chariot, while his charioteer also fell. The valiant Queen Kaikeyī, who had accompanied her royal husband to the field of battle assumed the role of a charioteer and removed the king to a safe retreat. When the king regained his consciousness and came to know of the timely help rendered by the queen he was immensely pleased and offered her a couple of boons. The queen, however, kept them in reserve and did not ask for anything on that occasion. <br><br> The Adhyātma-Rāmāyaṇa (forming part of the Brahmāṇḍa-Purāṇa), however, tells a different story. There we are told that while King Daśaratha was once fighting with the demons on behalf of the gods the axle of the wheels of his chariot got loosened and was about to fall when Queen Kaikeyī, who had accompanied the king to the battlefield, perceived it and inserting her own arm in place of the axle prevented the chariot from toppling down and held her arm in that position till her husband was able to vanquish his foe. The king was filled with admiration and gratitude when he marked this heroic feat of his queen and offered her two boons, which the queen prudently reserved for a future occasion. </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-5 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/2/2" > <span>Previous (Part - 2)</span> </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/2/4" > <span>Next (Part - 4)</span> </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Scriptures/Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (Tulsi Ramayana)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/2"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>2 - Ayodhyā Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/ramcharitmanas/2/3"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part - 3</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-title> Select language </swal-title> <swal-input type=select  value=hi  /> <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/language-selector.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
