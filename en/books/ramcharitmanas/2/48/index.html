the gift of sandals; Bharata&rsquo;s farewell</h4> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bhōra nhāi sabu jurā samājū. bharata bhūmisura tērahuti rājū..</h5> <h5>bhala dina āju jāni mana māhīṃ. rāmu kṛpāla kahata sakucāhīṃ..

[2-312-4]</h5> <p>On the morrow, after bathing, the whole assembly met again-Bharata, the Brāhmaṇas and the King of Tirahuta (Mithilā). Though knowing at heart that the day was auspicious (for undertaking a return journey to Ayodhyā) the tender-hearted Śrī Rāma hesitated to say so. Śrī Rāma looked at His preceptor (the sage Vasiṣṭha), King Janaka and the assembly; but the very next moment He felt nervous and turned His eyes to the ground. Praising His regard for others&rsquo; feelings the whole assembly thought that nowhere could one find a master so considerate as Śrī Rāma. Bharata, who was clever enough to perceive Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s wish, lovingly rose and imposing great restraint upon himself fell prostrate on the ground. Then, joining his palms, he lovingly said,&rdquo;My lord, you have granted me all my desires. For my sake everybody has suffered a good deal of trouble and you too have been put to much inconvenience. Now, my lord, give me your permission to leave, so that I may go back to Ayodhyā and remain there till your return.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>jēhiṃ upāya puni pāya janu dēkhai dīnadayāla.</h5> <h5>sō sikha dēia avadhi lagi kōsalapāla kṛpāla..313.. [2-313]</h5> <p>Admonish me, O gracious Lord of Kosala, and tell me some means by practising which for the remaining period of your exile your servant (myself) may be enabled to behold the feet of his merciful master again.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>purajana parijana prajā gōsāī. saba suci sarasa sanēhaom sagāī..</h5> <h5>rāura badi bhala bhava dukha dāhū. prabhu binu bādi parama pada lāhū.. [2-313-1]</h5> <h5>svāmi sujānu jāni saba hī kī. ruci lālasā rahani jana jī kī..</h5> <h5>pranatapālu pālihi saba kāhū. dēu duhū disi ōra nibāhū..

[2-313-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Your citizens, your kinsmen and your other subjects too, my lord, are all hallowed and steeped in joy because of the love they bear for you and the relationship they have with you. It is better to be tormented by the agonies of birth and death for your sake; while without you, my lord, it is no use attaining the supreme state (of blessedness). Knowing the hearts of all and even so the liking and longings of your servant&rsquo;s heart as well as his way of life, my all-wise lord, who is a protector of the suppliant, will protect all, and will take care of them, both in this world and in the next, till the last. I am fully confident of this in everyway; and when I ponder this, I am not in the least disturbed about it. My own distress and my lord&rsquo;s Kindness have both combined to make me impudent. Correcting this great fault of mine, my master, instruct this servant of yours without reserve.&rdquo; Everyone who heard Bharata&rsquo;s prayer applauded it and said, &ldquo;This supplication of Bharata is like a cygnet, that sifts milk from water.&rdquo;</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>dīnabaṃdhu suni baṃdhu kē bacana dīna chalahīna.</h5> <h5>dēsa kāla avasara sarisa bōlē rāmu prabīna..314.. [2-314]</h5> <p>The all-wise Śrī Rāma, the befriender of the afflicted, when He heard the meek and guileless speech of His brother (Bharata), replied in terms appropriate to the place, time and occasion:-</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>tāta tumhāri mōri parijana kī. ciṃtā gurahi nṛpahi ghara bana kī..</h5> <h5>māthē para gura muni mithilēsū. hamahi tumhahi sapanēhu na kalēsū..

[2-314-4]</h5> <p>&ldquo;Brother,- it is our preceptor (the sage Vasiṣṭha) and King Janaka who take thought for you and me as well as for our people, whether we be at home or in the forest. So long as our preceptor, the sage (Viśvāmitra) and the lord of Mithilā are our guardians, neither you nor I can even dream of trouble. For us two brothers, you as well as myself, the highest achievement of our human life, nay, our material gain, our glory, our virtue and our highest spiritual gain consist in this that both of us should obey our father&rsquo;s command. It is in vindicating the king&rsquo;s (our father&rsquo;s) reputation (by implementing his word) that our good lies both in the eyes of the world and in the estimation of the Vedas. Those who follow the advice of their preceptor, father, mother and master, never stumble even if they tread a wrong path. Pondering thus and putting away all anxiety go and rule over Ayodhyā till the appointed period. The responsibility for the protection of our land, treasury, kinsmen and our own people rests on the dust of our preceptor&rsquo;s feet. As for yourself you should protect the earth, your subjects and your capital in accordance with the advice of your preceptor (the sage Vasiṣṭha), mothers and the minister (Sumantra).</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>mukhiā mukhu sō cāhiai khāna pāna kahu ēka.</h5> <h5>pālai pōṣai sakala aomga tulasī sahita bibēka..315.. [2-315]</h5> <p>&ldquo;A chief should be like the mouth, which alone does all the eating and drinking but supports and nourishes all the other limbs with discretion, says Tulasīdāsa.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>rājadharama sarabasu ētanōī. jimi mana māhaom manōratha gōī..</h5> <h5>baṃdhu prabōdhu kīnha bahu bhāomtī. binu adhāra mana tōṣu na sāomtī.. [2-315-1]</h5> <h5>bharata sīla gura saciva samājū. sakuca sanēha bibasa raghurājū..</h5> <h5>prabhu kari kṛpā pāomvarīṃ dīnhīṃ. sādara bharata sīsa dhari līnhīṃ.. [2-315-2]</h5> <h5>caranapīṭha karunānidhāna kē. janu juga jāmika prajā prāna kē..</h5> <h5>saṃpuṭa bharata sanēha ratana kē. ākhara juga juna jīva jatana kē.. [2-315-3]</h5> <h5>kula kapāṭa kara kusala karama kē. bimala nayana sēvā sudharama kē..</h5> <h5>bharata mudita avalaṃba lahē tēṃ. asa sukha jasa siya rāmu rahē tēṃ.. [2-315-4]</h5> <p>The essence of a king&rsquo;s duty is only this much, which lies hidden in the Śāstras, even as a desire is cherished in the heart (before it is expressed).&rdquo; The Lord comforted His brother (Bharata) in many ways; but without some prop his mind found no consolation or rest. His regard for Bharata, on the one hand, and the presence of elders and ministers, on the other, overwhelmed tho Lord of Raghus with a mixed feeling of embarrassment and affection. The Lord at last took compassion on him and gave him His wooden sandals, which Bharata reverently placed on his head. The sandals of the all-merciful Lord were like two watchmen entrusted with, the duty of guarding the people&rsquo;s life or they might be compared to a pair of caskets to enshrine the jewel of Bharata&rsquo;s love or to the two syllables (constituting the word &lsquo;Rāma&rsquo;) intended for the (spiritual) practice of the human soul. Or they might be likened to a pair of doors to guard the race (of Raghu) or a pair of hands to assist in the performance of good deeds or again to a pair of eyes to show the noble path of service. Bharata was highly pleased to get this prop; he felt as happy as if Sītā and Śrī Rāma had agreed to stay (in Ayodhyā).</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>māgēu bidā pranāmu kari rāma liē ura lāi.</h5> <h5>lōga ucāṭē amarapati kuṭila kuavasaru pāi..316.. [2-316]</h5> <p>He made obeisance and begged leave to depart and Śrī Rāma clasped him to his bosom; while the malevolent lord of celestials, taking advantage of this adverse situation made the people weary.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sō kucāli saba kahaom bhai nīkī. avadhi āsa sama jīvani jī kī..</h5> <h5>nataru lakhana siya sama biyōgā. hahari marata saba lōga kurōgā.. [2-316-1]</h5> <h5>rāmakṛpāom avarēba sudhārī. bibudha dhāri bhai gunada gōhārī..</h5> <h5>bhēṃṭata bhuja bhari bhāi bharata sō. rāma prēma rasu kahi na parata sō.. [2-316-2]</h5> <h5>tana mana bacana umaga anurāgā. dhīra dhuraṃdhara dhīraju tyāgā..</h5> <h5>bārija lōcana mōcata bārī. dēkhi dasā sura sabhā dukhārī.. [2-316-3]</h5> <h5>munigana gura dhura dhīra janaka sē. gyāna anala mana kasēṃ kanaka sē..</h5> <h5>jē biraṃci niralēpa upāē. paduma patra jimi jaga jala jāē.. [2-316-4]</h5> <p>That mischief, however, proved a boon to all; it helped to sustain their life like the hope of Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s returning to Ayodhyā on the expiry of His term of exile. Otherwise people would have succumbed to the fell disease of separation from Lakṣmaṇa, Sītā and Rāma in great agony. By Śrī Rāma&rsquo;s grace the imbroglio was resolved and the gods, who were hostilely disposed (towards the people of Ayodhyā), now turned out helpful as allies. Śrī Rāma locked His brother, Bharata, in a close embrace; the ecstasy of His love cannot be described in words. His body, mind and speech overflowed with love and the firmest of the firm lost all firmness. His lotus eyes streamed with tears; even the assembly of gods was grieved to see His condition. The host of sages (assembled there), the preceptor (the sage Vasiṣṭha) and a champion of firmness like Janaka, the gold of whose mind had been tested in the fire of wisdom, nay, who were created by Brahma as free from all attachment and were born in this world even as the lotus springs up from water (and yet remains ever above it)-</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>tēu bilōki raghubara bharata prīti anūpa apāra.</h5> <h5>bhaē magana mana tana bacana sahita birāga bicāra..317.. [2-317]</h5> <p>Even they were overwhelmed in mind, body and speech and lost all reason and dispassion when they saw incomparable and boundless affection of Śrī Rāma (the Chief of Raghus) and Bharata.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>jahāom janaka gura mati bhōrī. prākṛta prīti kahata baḍai khōrī..</h5> <h5>baranata raghubara bharata biyōgū. suni kaṭhōra kabi jānihi lōgū.. [2-317-1]</h5> <h5>sō sakōca rasu akatha subānī. samau sanēhu sumiri sakucānī..</h5> <h5>bhēṃṭi bharata raghubara samujhāē. puni ripudavanu haraṣi hiyaom lāē.. [2-317-2]</h5> <h5>sēvaka saciva bharata rukha pāī. nija nija kāja lagē saba jāī..</h5> <h5>suni dāruna dukhu duhūom samājā. lagē calana kē sājana sājā.. [2-317-3]</h5> <h5>prabhu pada paduma baṃdi dōu bhāī. calē sīsa dhari rāma rajāī..</h5> <h5>muni tāpasa banadēva nihōrī. saba sanamāni bahōri bahōrī.. [2-317-4]</h5> <p>The affection (of Śrī Rāma and Bharata) which baffled the wits of King Janaka and the preceptor (Vasiṣṭha),-it would be a great blunder to call it mundane. People would account the poet hard-hearted if they heard him describe the parting of Śrī Rāma (the Chief of Raghus) and Bharata. The rapture of that delicacy was past all telling; thinking of the love that manifested itself on the occasion even eloquence shrunk into itself. Śrī Rāma (the Chief of Raghus) first embraced Bharata and consoled him; and then He gladly clasped Śatrughna to His bosom. Reading Bharata&rsquo;s mind his servants and ministers all left and set about their respective duties. The people in both the camps were sore distressed to learn this and began to prepare for the return journey. The two brothers (Bharata and Śatrughna) adored the lotus-feet of their lord and bowing to the orders of Śrī Rāma they set out on their journey. They supplicated the sages, ascetics and sylvan gods and honoured them again and again.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>lakhanahi bhēṃṭi pranāmu kari sira dhari siya pada dhūri.</h5> <h5>calē saprēma asīsa suni sakala sumaṃgala mūri..318.. [2-318]</h5> <p>Bharata then embraced Lakṣmaṇa, while Śatrughna bowed to him and both placed the dust of Sītā&rsquo;s feet on their head; and receiving Her loving benediction, which was the root of all fair blessings, they departed</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>sānuja rāma nṛpahi sira nāī. kīnhi bahuta bidhi binaya baḍaāī..</h5> <h5>dēva dayā basa baḍa dukhu pāyau. sahita samāja kānanahiṃ āyau.. [2-318-1]</h5> <h5>pura pagu dhāria dēi asīsā. kīnha dhīra dhari gavanu mahīsā..</h5> <h5>muni mahidēva sādhu sanamānē. bidā kiē hari hara sama jānē.. [2-318-2]</h5> <h5>sāsu samīpa gaē dōu bhāī. phirē baṃdi paga āsiṣa pāī..</h5> <h5>kausika bāmadēva jābālī. purajana parijana saciva sucālī.. [2-318-3]</h5> <h5>jathā jōgu kari binaya pranāmā. bidā kiē saba sānuja rāmā..</h5> <h5>nāri puruṣa laghu madhya baḍaērē. saba sanamāni kṛpānidhi phērē.. [2-318-4]</h5> <p>Śrī Rāma with His younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) bowed His head to King Janaka and supplicated and extolled him in many ways:&rdquo;Moved by compassion for us, my lord, you suffered much and came all the way to this forest with your retinue. Now kindly bestow your blessings on us and return to your capital.&rdquo; At this the king took courage and departed. The Lord also treated with honour the sages and other Brāhmaṇas and holy men and bade good-bye to them with the same respect as is due to Hari (Bhagavān Viṣṇu) and Hara (Lord Śiva). The two brothers (Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa) then called on their mother-in-law and having adored her feet and received her blessings they came back. Śrī Rāma and His younger brother Lakṣmaṇa) took leave of the sages Kauśika (Viśvāmitra), Vāmadeva and Jābāli, the citizens, His own kinsmen and faithful ministers with due courtesy and obeisance. The gracious Lord sent back men and women of all ranks-high, low and middling-with due honour.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>bharata mātu pada baṃdi prabhu suci sanēhaom mili bhēṃṭi.</h5> <h5>bidā kīnha saji pālakī sakuca sōca saba mēṭi..319.. [2-319]</h5> <p>With sincere affection the Lord adored the feet of Bharata&rsquo;s mother (Kaikeyī) and embraced her, and having removed all her embarrassment and grief saw her off in a palanquin duly equipped for the purpose</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>parijana mātu pitahi mili sītā. phirī prānapriya prēma punītā..</h5> <h5>kari pranāmu bhēṃṭī saba sāsū. prīti kahata kabi hiyaom na hulāsū.. [2-319-1]</h5> <h5>suni sikha abhimata āsiṣa pāī. rahī sīya duhu prīti samāī..</h5> <h5>raghupati paṭu pālakīṃ magāīṃ. kari prabōdhu saba mātu caḍhaāī..

[2-319-4]</h5> <p>Sītā, who cherished unalloyed love for Her most beloved lord returned after meeting Her kinsmen, father (King Janaka) and mother (Queen Sunayanā). Making obeisance to Her mothers-in-law She embraced them all; the poet has no enthusiasm left in his heart to describe Her affection. Listening to their advice and receiving benedictions of Her liking Sītā was lost in the love both of Her parents and mothersin-law. The Lord of Raghus sent for the beautiful palanquins and with words of consolation He helped all His mothers mount them. The two brothers (Śrī Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa) embraced them again and again with equal affection and sent them off. Equipping the horses, elephants and vehicles of every description the hosts of Bharata and King Janaka set out on their journey. With their hearts full of Rāma, Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa, all the people went on their journey as if in a trance. Even the bullocks, horses, elephants and other animals trudged on against their will, sad at heart and depressed in spirits.</p> <h4>Dohas</h4> <h5>gura guratiya pada baṃdi prabhu sītā lakhana samēta.</h5> <h5>phirē haraṣa bisamaya sahita āē parana nikēta..320.. [2-320]</h5> <p>Adoring the feet of the Guru (the sage Vasiṣṭha) and the Guru&rsquo;s wife (Arundhatī) the Lord as well as Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa returned with a mixed feeling of joy and sorrow to their hut of leaves.</p> <h4>Chaupais</h4> <h5>bidā kīnha sanamāni niṣādū. calēu hṛdayaom baḍa biraha biṣādū..</h5> <h5>kōla kirāta bhilla banacārī. phērē phirē jōhāri jōhārī.. [2-320-1]</h5> <h5>prabhu siya lakhana baiṭhi baṭa chāhīṃ. priya parijana biyōga bilakhāhīṃ..</h5> <h5>bharata sanēha subhāu subānī. priyā anuja sana kahata bakhānī..

[2-320-4]</h5> <p>The Niṣāda chief was courteously sent away and departed; leaving the Lord was a great wrench to him. Pressed to return, the Kolas, Kirātas, Bhīlas and other foresters returned after bowing again and again. The lord with Sītā and Lakṣmaṇa sat down in the shade of a banyan tree and grieved over their separation from their near and dear ones. He described to His beloved spouse (Sītā) and younger brother (Lakṣmaṇa) the affection, noble disposition and polite speech of Bharata. Overpowered by love Śrī Rāma extolled with His own blessed lips Bharata&rsquo;s faith and affection in thought, word and deed. At that time the birds, beasts and the fish in water,-nay, all the animate and inanimate creatures of Citrakūṭa felt disconsolate. The gods, when they saw the condition of Śrī Rāma (the Chief of Raghus), rained down flowers and told Him what had been going on in their homes.
