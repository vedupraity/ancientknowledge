I have regained my memory by Your mercy. I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions.</p> <h4>Purport</h4> <p>The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self-discipline. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity’s constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the illusory māyā or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of māyā to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order.</p> <p>The word moha is very important in this verse. Moha refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally a servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not a servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p> <p>Kṛṣṇa consciousness is acting according to Kṛṣṇa’s order. A conditioned soul, illusioned by the external energy of matter, does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of māyā. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-gītā from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that Kṛṣṇa was not only his friend but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood Kṛṣṇa factually. So to study Bhagavad-gītā is to understand Kṛṣṇa factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. When Arjuna understood that it was Kṛṣṇa’s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to Kṛṣṇa’s desire. He again took up his weapons – his arrows and bow – to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pt-6 pb-0"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/en/books/bhagavad-gita/18/72" > <span>Previous (Chapter 18 - Verse 72)</span> </a> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/en/books/bhagavad-gita/18/74" > <span>Next (Chapter 18 - Verse 74)</span> </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Scriptures/Books</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/bhagavad-gita"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shrimad Bhagavad Gita - As It Is</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/en/books/bhagavad-gita/18"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Chapter 18 - Mokṣa Saṃnyāsa Yoga</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a class=strong  tabindex=-1  href="/en/books/bhagavad-gita/18/73"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Chapter 18 - Verse 73</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img loading=lazy  src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png" > </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <template id=language-selector-swal-template > <swal-html> <div class=content > <p>Please select your language</p> </div> </swal-html> <swal-input type=radio  value=hi > <swal-input-option value=hi >Hindi</swal-input-option> <swal-input-option value=en >English</swal-input-option> </swal-input> <swal-button type=confirm > Confirm </swal-button> <swal-button type=cancel > Cancel </swal-button> <swal-param name=allowOutsideClick  value=false  /> <swal-param name=scrollbarPadding  value=false  /> <swal-param name=customClass  value='{ "confirmButton": "button is-warning is-outlined", "cancelButton": "button is-grey is-outlined" }' /> </template> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2@11.3.3/dist/sweetalert2.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/language-selector.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
