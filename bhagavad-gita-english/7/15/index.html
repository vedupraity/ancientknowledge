                                        It is said in Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality K·πõ·π£·πáa one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don‚Äôt these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?

                                        The Gƒ´tƒÅ answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like BrahmƒÅ, ≈öiva, Kapila, the KumƒÅras, Manu, VyƒÅsa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, PrahlƒÅda, Bali, and later on MadhvƒÅcƒÅrya, RƒÅmƒÅnujƒÅcƒÅrya, ≈örƒ´ Caitanya and many others ‚Äì who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc. ‚Äì surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of ‚Äúplanning commissions.‚Äù

                                        In the Gƒ´tƒÅ it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hira·πáyaka≈õipu and RƒÅva·πáa, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These du·π£k·πõtinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below.

They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yaj√±a (sacrifice).

                                        Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such m≈´·∏çhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life‚Äôs all in all ‚Äì despite the fact that the m≈´·∏çhas enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane world, but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living force that moves the material world.

                                        (2) Another class of du·π£k·πõtƒ´, or miscreant, is called the narƒÅdhama, or the lowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered narƒÅdhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man‚Äôs relation with Him. In the Gƒ´tƒÅ the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant for man‚Äôs reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a narƒÅdhama. We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother‚Äôs womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by mƒÅyƒÅ, the illusory energy.

                                        It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the Manu-sm·πõti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of var·πáƒÅ≈õrama. However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is narƒÅdhama.

According to the standard of the Gƒ´tƒÅ, a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned brƒÅhma·πáa, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. ≈örƒ´ NityƒÅnanda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical narƒÅdhamas, the brothers JagƒÅi and MƒÅdhƒÅi, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the narƒÅdhama who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.

Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the Gƒ´tƒÅ. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead, cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa.
