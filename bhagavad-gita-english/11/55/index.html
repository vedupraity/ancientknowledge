                                        Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K·πõ·π£·πáaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, K·πõ·π£·πáa, must take this formula, as stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. The Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service.

                                        No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K·πõ·π£·πáa. This is called k·πõ·π£·πáa-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one has to do business for K·πõ·π£·πáa. If K·πõ·π£·πáa is the proprietor of the business, then K·πõ·π£·πáa should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K·πõ·π£·πáa, he can do it. This is work for K·πõ·π£·πáa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K·πõ·π£·πáa, and he can install the Deity of K·πõ·π£·πáa and arrange for the Deity‚Äôs service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all k·πõ·π£·πáa-karma. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa, and one should accept as prasƒÅdam the remnants of offerings to K·πõ·π£·πáa. If one constructs a very big building for K·πõ·π£·πáa and installs the Deity of K·πõ·π£·πáa, one is not prohibited from living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is K·πõ·π£·πáa. That is called K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K·πõ·π£·πáa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K·πõ·π£·πáa; that is also k·πõ·π£·πáa-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land ‚Äì in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land ‚Äì can utilize that for K·πõ·π£·πáa by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow tulasƒ´ plants, because tulasƒ´ leaves are very important and K·πõ·π£·πáa has recommended this in Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. Patra·πÅ pu·π£pa·πÅ phala·πÅ toyam. K·πõ·π£·πáa desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water ‚Äì and by such an offering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulasƒ´. So one can sow tulasƒ´ and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K·πõ·π£·πáa.

                                        The word mat-parama·∏• refers to one who considers the association of K·πõ·π£·πáa in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahma-jyotir effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K·πõ·π£·πáaloka, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta·∏•, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.

                                        The term sa·πÖga-varjita·∏• is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K·πõ·π£·πáa.

                                        In this verse ≈örƒ´la R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa, that is called pure devotional service. ƒÄnuk≈´lyasya sa·πÖkalpa·∏• prƒÅtik≈´lyasya varjanam (Hari-bhakti-vilƒÅsa 11.676). One should think of K·πõ·π£·πáa and act for K·πõ·π£·πáa favorably, not unfavorably. Ka·πÅsa was an enemy of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs. From the very beginning of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs birth, Ka·πÅsa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious in every respect, but that K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K·πõ·π£·πáa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K·πõ·π£·πáa attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana. His only objective is to serve K·πõ·π£·πáa wherever he may be.

                                        A devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy (nirvaira·∏•). How is this? A devotee situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness knows that only devotional service to K·πõ·π£·πáa can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as ·π¨hƒÅkura HaridƒÅsa and PrahlƒÅda MahƒÅrƒÅja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and it is difficult. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one‚Äôs neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K·πõ·π£·πáa is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.

                                        In summary, the universal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi·π£·πáu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus K·πõ·π£·πáa is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K·πõ·π£·πáa is a manifestation of the original vi≈õva-r≈´pa, or Vi·π£·πáu. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi·π£·πáus, but for a devotee no form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is important but the original form, two-handed ≈öyƒÅmasundara. In the Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ it is stated that those who are attached to the ≈öyƒÅmasundara form of K·πõ·π£·πáa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is essential and supreme.
