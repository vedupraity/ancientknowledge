                                            My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.

                                            K·πõ·π£·πáa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K·πõ·π£·πáa or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very difficult to understand by study of the Vedas or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on JanmƒÅ·π£·π≠amƒ´, the day on which K·πõ·π£·πáa appeared, and on the two days of EkƒÅda≈õƒ´ (the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K·πõ·π£·πáa who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K·πõ·π£·πáa philosophy, or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, throughout the world. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ as the most munificent man of charity because love of K·πõ·π£·πáa, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, that charity, given to spread K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is the greatest charity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi·π£·πáu or K·πõ·π£·πáa), that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature (≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad 6.23):

                                            One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand K·πõ·π£·πáa by mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa.

                                            The personal forms of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are described as su-durdar≈õam, very difficult to see. They are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa and the two-handed form of K·πõ·π£·πáa are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The words tvad anyena na d·πõ·π£·π≠a-p≈´rvam (verse 47) state that before Arjuna, no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K·πõ·π£·πáa at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.

                                            The word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in Vedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Only then can one attempt to write commentaries on Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.

                                            K·πõ·π£·πáa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K·πõ·π£·πáa. He is the origin of all emanations. K·πõ·π£·πáa is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K·πõ·π£·πáa are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K·πõ·π£·πáa (which is known as MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord.

                                            Similarly, in Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ the Lord says, matta·∏• paratara·πÅ nƒÅnyat: ‚ÄúThere is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, aham ƒÅdir hi devƒÅnƒÅm: ‚ÄúI am the origin of all the demigods.‚Äù And after understanding Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ from K·πõ·π£·πáa, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para·πÅ brahma para·πÅ dhƒÅma pavitra·πÅ parama·πÅ bhavƒÅn, ‚ÄúI now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.‚Äù Therefore the universal form which K·πõ·π£·πáa showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K·πõ·π£·πáa form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God‚Äôs original form.

                                            The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K·πõ·π£·πáa in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who was a constant companion of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the two-handed form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is the most dear.
