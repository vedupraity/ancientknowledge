                                        In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as daivƒ´ prak·πõti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.

                                        The word abhijƒÅtasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as GarbhƒÅdhƒÅna-sa·πÅskƒÅra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles recommended for the social life of the human being. In Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself. Sex life is not condemned, provided the process is used in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Those who are in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father and mother absorbed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.

                                        In the var·πáƒÅ≈õrama institution the sannyƒÅsƒ´, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. A brƒÅhma·πáa is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k·π£atriyas, the vai≈õyas and the ≈õ≈´dras, but a sannyƒÅsƒ´, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the brƒÅhma·πáas also. For a sannyƒÅsƒ´, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sannyƒÅsƒ´ has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one thinks, ‚ÄúAfter I leave my connections, who will protect me?‚Äù he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that K·πõ·π£·πáa or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ is always within, that He is seeing everything, and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that K·πõ·π£·πáa as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. ‚ÄúI shall never be alone,‚Äù one should think. ‚ÄúEven if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K·πõ·π£·πáa, and He will give me all protection.‚Äù That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.

                                        Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sannyƒÅsƒ´ is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyƒÅsƒ´, and when He was at Purƒ´ His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyƒÅsƒ´ not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyƒÅsƒ´, intimate relations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sannyƒÅsƒ´ was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannyƒÅsa order of life in connection with association with women. One of His personal associates, namely Cho·π≠a HaridƒÅsa, was associated with Lord Caitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Cho·π≠a HaridƒÅsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, ‚ÄúFor a sannyƒÅsƒ´ or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification ‚Äì not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity ‚Äì is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.‚Äù So these are the processes for purification.

                                        The next item is j√±ƒÅna-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. SannyƒÅsƒ´ life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sannyƒÅsƒ´ is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyƒÅsƒ´ goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. This is the duty of a sannyƒÅsƒ´. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness with logic and understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sannyƒÅsƒ´, or one in the renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-sa·πÅ≈õuddhi (purity) and j√±ƒÅna-yoga (knowledge).

                                        The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charity, as will be explained later on ‚Äì charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness.

                                        Then as far as dama (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality, but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving K·πõ·π£·πáa. If he is able to beget children who will be in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.

                                        Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Those in other orders of life, namely brahmacarya, vƒÅnaprastha and sannyƒÅsa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householders. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a. This sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a, the chanting of Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.

                                        Then svƒÅdhyƒÅya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life. BrahmacƒÅrƒ´s should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called svƒÅdhyƒÅya.

                                        Tapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life ‚Äì brahmacarya, g·πõhastha, vƒÅnaprastha and sannyƒÅsa. So after g·πõhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma society is meant for tapasya. Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. Such theories are manufactured by show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don‚Äôt restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.

                                        Ahi·πÅsƒÅ means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi·πÅsƒÅ means not checking anyone‚Äôs progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one‚Äôs palate. This is called ahi·πÅsƒÅ.

                                        Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding the Vedas. ≈öruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.

                                        Akrodha means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apai≈õunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hrƒ´ means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. AcƒÅpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination.
