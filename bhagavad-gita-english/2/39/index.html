                                        According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sa·πÖkhyƒÅ means that which describes things in detail, and sƒÅ·πÖkhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna‚Äôs proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. K·πõ·π£·πáa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as SƒÅ·πÖkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This SƒÅ·πÖkhya has nothing to do with the SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila‚Äôs SƒÅ·πÖkhya, the SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy was expounded in the ≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, who explained it to His mother, Devah≈´ti. It is clearly explained by Him that the puru·π£a, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prak·πõti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gƒ´tƒÅ. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prak·πõti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of mƒÅyƒÅ, or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto VƒÅsudeva, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.

                                        Arjuna has already accepted K·πõ·π£·πáa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: ≈õi·π£yas te ‚Äôha·πÅ ≈õƒÅdhi mƒÅ·πÅ tvƒÅ·πÅ prapannam. Consequently, K·πõ·π£·πáa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ in everyone‚Äôs heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.

                                        Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word SƒÅ·πÖkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic SƒÅ·πÖkhya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the ≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam, but even that SƒÅ·πÖkhya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, SƒÅ·πÖkhya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs SƒÅ·πÖkhya and Lord Kapila‚Äôs SƒÅ·πÖkhya, as described in the BhƒÅgavatam, are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga (sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yogau p·πõthag bƒÅlƒÅ·∏• pravadanti na pa·πá·∏çitƒÅ·∏•).

                                        Of course, atheistic sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.

                                        One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.
