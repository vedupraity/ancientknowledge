                                        In this verse it is clearly indicated that K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs mind and K·πõ·π£·πáa. K·πõ·π£·πáa is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, His mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the K≈´rma PurƒÅ·πáa, as it is quoted by BhaktisiddhƒÅnta Sarasvatƒ´ GosvƒÅmƒ´ in his AnubhƒÅ·π£ya comments on Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta (Fifth Chapter, ƒÄdi-lƒ´lƒÅ, verses 41‚Äì48), deha-dehi-vibhedo ‚Äôya·πÅ ne≈õvare vidyate kvacit. This means that there is no difference in K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But because the commentators do not know this science of K·πõ·π£·πáa, they hide K·πõ·π£·πáa and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa, some men make profit out of misleading people.

                                        There are some who are demonic; they also think of K·πõ·π£·πáa, but enviously, just like King Ka·πÅsa, K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs uncle. He was also thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa always, but he thought of K·πõ·π£·πáa as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K·πõ·π£·πáa would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa continuously. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K·πõ·π£·πáa will help one become a devotee. Understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa otherwise, from the wrong source, will prove fruitless.

                                        One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa; with conviction in his heart that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K·πõ·π£·πáa. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities ‚Äì everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K·πõ·π£·πáa without deviation. This will help one transfer to K·πõ·π£·πáaloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K·πõ·π£·πáa. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society.

                                        The Seventh and Eighth chapters of Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ have explained pure devotional service to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic yoga and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal brahma-jyotir and localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.

                                        There is a beautiful poem about K·πõ·π£·πáa in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K·πõ·π£·πáa. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yogƒ´s. One who always engages in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness should be understood to be a perfectly saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to the process of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of K·πõ·π£·πáa.
