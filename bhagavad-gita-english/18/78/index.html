                                        The Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ began with an inquiry of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra‚Äôs. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhƒ´·π£ma, Dro·πáa and Kar·πáa. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battlefield, Sa√±jaya told the King, ‚ÄúYou are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.‚Äù He directly confirmed that Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K·πõ·π£·πáa was there. K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. K·πõ·π£·πáa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K·πõ·π£·πáa is also the master of renunciation.

                                        The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi·π£·π≠hira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi·π£·π≠hira. Because K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi·π£·π≠hira, Yudhi·π£·π≠hira‚Äôs victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sa√±jaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhi·π£·π≠hira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi·π£·π≠hira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.

                                        There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K·πõ·π£·πáa incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: man-manƒÅ bhava mad-bhakta·∏•. One must become a devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa (sarva-dharmƒÅn parityajya mƒÅm eka·πÅ ≈õara·πáa·πÅ vraja). The instructions of Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the Gƒ´tƒÅ is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.

                                        From Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa in devotional service in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.

                                        Another feature of Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features ‚Äì impersonal Brahman, localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa. If one understands K·πõ·π£·πáa, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K·πõ·π£·πáa is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.

                                        In Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth ‚Äì impersonal Brahman, localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and any other transcendental conception ‚Äì exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya‚Äôs philosophy is that of ‚Äúinconceivable oneness and difference.‚Äù This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.

                                        The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of K·πõ·π£·πáa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.
